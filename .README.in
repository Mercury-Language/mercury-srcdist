In some cases, additional steps may be needed for particular operating systems
or particular architectures, so first read the README file for your particular
platform, if there is one:

	README.FreeBSD		FreeBSD on Intel x86 and x86_64
	README.HPUX		HPPA systems running HPUX

The documentation sources are in the `doc' subdirectory.  The installation
process will install INFO, HTML, and DVI versions in the locations specified
in the file Mmake.common - by default these locations are
/usr/local/mercury-@VERSION@/info,
/usr/local/mercury-@VERSION@/lib/mercury/html,
and /usr/local/mercury-@VERSION@/lib/mercury/doc respectively.
The installation process will also install Unix-style man pages -
by default they will be installed in /usr/local/mercury-@VERSION@/man/man1.
The files RELEASE_NOTES, NEWS, HISTORY, LIMITATIONS, and BUGS
also contain useful information.  If you're interested in looking
at the source code, the file compiler/notes/compiler_design.html is
a good place to start.

The `samples' directory contains some example Mercury programs.
There are also some additional Mercury programs and libraries
in the `extras' directory.
