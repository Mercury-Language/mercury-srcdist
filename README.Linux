This file documents the Linux/x86 and Linux/x86_64 ports.
For the Linux/PowerPC port, see README.Linux-PPC.
For the Linux/Apha port, see README.Linux-Alpha.
(Ports to Linux on other architectures have not yet
been attempted, but should not be difficult.)

Linux systems that produce executables in a.out format are not supported by
the Mercury compiler.
