Mercury 0.13 may not work on Solaris 10 (SunOS 5.10) due to incompatibilities
with the version of Boehm GC shipped with that version of Mercury.

(The above problem has been fixed in post-0.13 versions of Mercury.)

Also, note that `--linkage static' is not supported on Solaris.  Executables
produced using this option will cause a segmentation fault.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With Solaris 10 on SPARC based systems the Mercury compiler needs to be built
with C compiler optimizations disabled.  To do this put the line:

    EXTRA_CFLAGS = -O0

in a file named 'Mmake.params' in the top-level of the source tree.
(i.e. in the same directory as this README file.)
