Two library modules, lex and regex, provide facilities for the
construction of lexical analyzers and for string matching and search
and replace functionality respectively.

README.lex provides a brief introduction to the lex module.

README.regex provides a brief introduction to the regex module.

The Mmakefile includes instructions for building and installing these
libraries.
