This directory contains the program gen_merc_wxs, which can be used to generate
a windows installer for the Mercury distribution.

To compile gen_merc_wxs, first build the wix library in the parent directory
and then do:

mmc --make gen_merc_wxs

The script gen_merc_msi can then be used to generate a Windows installer
for Mercury.  See the comments in that script for usage information.
