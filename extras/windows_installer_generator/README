This is the top-level module for a Mercury Wix source file generator.
WiX is an XML language that is used to generate Microsoft Windows Installer
(.msi) packages.

To compile the XML into an .msi file you need the WiX compiler, available
from wix.sourceforge.net.  You will also need a tool to generate
GUID. GUIDs are unique identifiers that Windows uses to identify all
the components in a package.  A GUID generator for Linux is uuidgen.
Microsoft Visual Studio also comes with a GUID generator, uuidgen.exe.

For documentation on the toolkit API see wix.m in this directory.

The predicate wix.installer.generate_installer will generate a .wxs file
based on information in its arguments.

The .wxs file can then be compiled to a .msi file using the Wix toolset.
The following commands will generate <filename>.msi, given <filename>.wxs.

candle <filename>.wxs
light <filename>.wixobj

NOTE that there are still a few features missing from the current
implementation.  For example the user cannot select different features of a
product to install -- it's all or nothing.  Also Windows installer error codes
are not converted into friendlier error messages at the moment.  The installer
wizard is also not as customizable as it could be.

To build the wix library execute the command:

mmc --make libwix
