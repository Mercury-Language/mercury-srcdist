This directory contains sample files for running the XML parser.

Build the parser in the extras/xml directory, i.e. our parent directory,
with

    mmake tryit.depend
    mmake tryit

You can then test the parser in the extras/xml/samples directory,
i.e. this directory, with:

    ../tryit newsarticles.xml

The files in this directory are:

README              This file.
catalog             A catalog file.
newsarticles.dtd    A sample news article DTD file.
newsarticles.xml    A sample news article XML 1.0 file.
