%Abstract
%
%   The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a subset of SGML that is
%   completely described in this document. Its goal is to enable generic
%   SGML to be served, received, and processed on the Web in the way that
%   is now possible with HTML. XML has been designed for ease of
%   implementation and for interoperability with both SGML and HTML.
%   
%Status of this document
%
%   This document has been reviewed by W3C Members and other interested
%   parties and has been endorsed by the Director as a W3C Recommendation.
%   It is a stable document and may be used as reference material or cited
%   as a normative reference from another document. W3C's role in making
%   the Recommendation is to draw attention to the specification and to
%   promote its widespread deployment. This enhances the functionality and
%   interoperability of the Web.
%   
%   This document specifies a syntax created by subsetting an existing,
%   widely used international text processing standard (Standard
%   Generalized Markup Language, ISO 8879:1986(E) as amended and
%   corrected) for use on the World Wide Web. It is a product of the W3C
%   XML Activity, details of which can be found at http://www.w3.org/XML.
%   A list of current W3C Recommendations and other technical documents
%   can be found at http://www.w3.org/TR.
%   
%   This specification uses the term URI, which is defined by [Berners-Lee
%   et al.], a work in progress expected to update [IETF RFC1738] and
%   [IETF RFC1808].

%1. Introduction
%
%   Extensible Markup Language, abbreviated XML, describes a class of data
%   objects called XML documents and partially describes the behavior of
%   computer programs which process them. XML is an application profile or
%   restricted form of SGML, the Standard Generalized Markup Language [ISO
%   8879]. By construction, XML documents are conforming SGML documents.
%   
%   XML documents are made up of storage units called entities, which
%   contain either parsed or unparsed data. Parsed data is made up of
%   characters, some of which form character data, and some of which form
%   markup. Markup encodes a description of the document's storage layout
%   and logical structure. XML provides a mechanism to impose constraints
%   on the storage layout and logical structure.
%   
%   A software module called an XML processor is used to read XML
%   documents and provide access to their content and structure. It is
%   assumed that an XML processor is doing its work on behalf of another
%   module, called the application. This specification describes the
%   required behavior of an XML processor in terms of how it must read XML
%   data and the information it must provide to the application.
%   
%  1.1 Origin and Goals
%  
%   XML was developed by an XML Working Group (originally known as the
%   SGML Editorial Review Board) formed under the auspices of the World
%   Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1996. It was chaired by Jon Bosak of Sun
%   Microsystems with the active participation of an XML Special Interest
%   Group (previously known as the SGML Working Group) also organized by
%   the W3C. The membership of the XML Working Group is given in an
%   appendix. Dan Connolly served as the WG's contact with the W3C.
%   
%   The design goals for XML are:
%    1. XML shall be straightforwardly usable over the Internet.
%    2. XML shall support a wide variety of applications.
%    3. XML shall be compatible with SGML.
%    4. It shall be easy to write programs which process XML documents.
%    5. The number of optional features in XML is to be kept to the
%       absolute minimum, ideally zero.
%    6. XML documents should be human-legible and reasonably clear.
%    7. The XML design should be prepared quickly.
%    8. The design of XML shall be formal and concise.
%    9. XML documents shall be easy to create.
%   10. Terseness in XML markup is of minimal importance.
%       
%   This specification, together with associated standards (Unicode and
%   ISO/IEC 10646 for characters, Internet RFC 1766 for language
%   identification tags, ISO 639 for language name codes, and ISO 3166 for
%   country name codes), provides all the information necessary to
%   understand XML Version 1.0 and construct computer programs to process
%   it.
%   
%   This version of the XML specification may be distributed freely, as
%   long as all text and legal notices remain intact.
%   
%  1.2 Terminology
%  
%   The terminology used to describe XML documents is defined in the body
%   of this specification. The terms defined in the following list are
%   used in building those definitions and in describing the actions of an
%   XML processor:
%   
%   may
%          Conforming documents and XML processors are permitted to but
%          need not behave as described.
%          
%   must
%          Conforming documents and XML processors are required to behave
%          as described; otherwise they are in error.
%          
%   error
%          A violation of the rules of this specification; results are
%          undefined. Conforming software may detect and report an error
%          and may recover from it.
%          
%   fatal error
%          An error which a conforming XML processor must detect and
%          report to the application. After encountering a fatal error,
%          the processor may continue processing the data to search for
%          further errors and may report such errors to the application.
%          In order to support correction of errors, the processor may
%          make unprocessed data from the document (with intermingled
%          character data and markup) available to the application. Once a
%          fatal error is detected, however, the processor must not
%          continue normal processing (i.e., it must not continue to pass
%          character data and information about the document's logical
%          structure to the application in the normal way).
%          
%   at user option
%          Conforming software may or must (depending on the modal verb in
%          the sentence) behave as described; if it does, it must provide
%          users a means to enable or disable the behavior described.
%          
%   validity constraint
%          A rule which applies to all valid XML documents. Violations of
%          validity constraints are errors; they must, at user option, be
%          reported by validating XML processors.
%          
%   well-formedness constraint
%          A rule which applies to all well-formed XML documents.
%          Violations of well-formedness constraints are fatal errors.
%          
%   match
%          (Of strings or names:) Two strings or names being compared must
%          be identical. Characters with multiple possible representations
%          in ISO/IEC 10646 (e.g. characters with both precomposed and
%          base+diacritic forms) match only if they have the same
%          representation in both strings. At user option, processors may
%          normalize such characters to some canonical form. No case
%          folding is performed. (Of strings and rules in the grammar:) A
%          string matches a grammatical production if it belongs to the
%          language generated by that production. (Of content and content
%          models:) An element matches its declaration when it conforms in
%          the fashion described in the constraint "Element Valid".
%          
%   for compatibility
%          A feature of XML included solely to ensure that XML remains
%          compatible with SGML.
%          
%   for interoperability
%          A non-binding recommendation included to increase the chances
%          that XML documents can be processed by the existing installed
%          base of SGML processors which predate the WebSGML Adaptations
%          Annex to ISO 8879.
%          
%2. Documents
%
%   A data object is an XML document if it is well-formed, as defined in
%   this specification. A well-formed XML document may in addition be
%   valid if it meets certain further constraints.
%   
%   Each XML document has both a logical and a physical structure.
%   Physically, the document is composed of units called entities. An
%   entity may refer to other entities to cause their inclusion in the
%   document. A document begins in a "root" or document entity. Logically,
%   the document is composed of declarations, elements, comments,
%   character references, and processing instructions, all of which are
%   indicated in the document by explicit markup. The logical and physical
%   structures must nest properly, as described in "4.3.2 Well-Formed
%   Parsed Entities".
%   
%  2.1 Well-Formed XML Documents
%  
%   A textual object is a well-formed XML document if:
%    1. Taken as a whole, it matches the production labeled document.
%    2. It meets all the well-formedness constraints given in this
%       specification.
%    3. Each of the parsed entities which is referenced directly or
%       indirectly within the document is well-formed.

%   
%   Matching the document production implies that:
%    1. It contains one or more elements.
%    2. There is exactly one element, called the root, or document
%       element, no part of which appears in the content of any other
%       element. For all other elements, if the start-tag is in the
%       content of another element, the end-tag is in the content of the
%       same element. More simply stated, the elements, delimited by
%       start- and end-tags, nest properly within each other.
%       
%   As a consequence of this, for each non-root element C in the document,
%   there is one other element P in the document such that C is in the
%   content of P, but is not in the content of any other element that is
%   in the content of P. P is referred to as the parent of C, and C as a
%   child of P.
%   
%  2.2 Characters
%  
%   A parsed entity contains text, a sequence of characters, which may
%   represent markup or character data. A character is an atomic unit of
%   text as specified by ISO/IEC 10646 [ISO/IEC 10646]. Legal characters
%   are tab, carriage return, line feed, and the legal graphic characters
%   of Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646. The use of "compatibility characters",
%   as defined in section 6.8 of [Unicode], is discouraged.
%   
%   Character Range
%   [2]  Char ::= #x9 | #xA | #xD | [#x20-#xD7FF] | [#xE000-#xFFFD]
%   | [#x10000-#x10FFFF] /* any Unicode character, excluding the surrogate
%   blocks, FFFE, and FFFF. */

:- pred char(pstate(_), pstate(unicode)).
:- mode char(in, out) is det.

    tok					then (pred(C::in, pdi, puo) is det -->
    ( {
    	C = 0x09
    ;
    	C = 0x0A
    ;
    	C = 0x0D
    ;
    	C >= 0x20, C =< 0xD7FF
    ;
    	C >= 0xE000, C =< 0xFFFD
    ;
    	C >= 0x10000, C =< 0x10FFFF
    } ->
    	return(C)
    ;
    	{ format("Unexpected character `%x'.", [i(C)], Msg) },
	error(Msg)
    )).

%   
%   The mechanism for encoding character code points into bit patterns may
%   vary from entity to entity. All XML processors must accept the UTF-8
%   and UTF-16 encodings of 10646; the mechanisms for signaling which of
%   the two is in use, or for bringing other encodings into play, are
%   discussed later, in "4.3.3 Character Encoding in Entities".
%   
%  2.3 Common Syntactic Constructs
%  
%   This section defines some symbols used widely in the grammar.
%   
%   S (white space) consists of one or more space (#x20) characters,
%   carriage returns, line feeds, or tabs.
%   
%   White Space
%   [3]  S ::= (#x20 | #x9 | #xD | #xA)+

:- pred s(pstate(_), pstate(list(unicode))).
:- mode s(in, out) is det.

s -->
    plus(s0).

:- pred s0(pstate(_), pstate(unicode)).
:- mode s0(in, out) is det.

s0 -->
    tok					then (pred(C::in, pdi, puo) is det -->
    ( {
    	C = 0x20
    ;
    	C = 0x09
    ;
    	C = 0x0D
    ;
    	C = 0x0A
    } ->
    	return(C)
    ;
    	fail("not whitespace")
    )).

%   
%   Characters are classified for convenience as letters, digits, or other
%   characters. Letters consist of an alphabetic or syllabic base
%   character possibly followed by one or more combining characters, or of
%   an ideographic character. Full definitions of the specific characters
%   in each class are given in "B. Character Classes".
%   
%   A Name is a token beginning with a letter or one of a few punctuation
%   characters, and continuing with letters, digits, hyphens, underscores,
%   colons, or full stops, together known as name characters. Names
%   beginning with the string "xml", or any string which would match
%   (('X'|'x') ('M'|'m') ('L'|'l')), are reserved for standardization in
%   this or future versions of this specification.
%   
%   Note: The colon character within XML names is reserved for
%   experimentation with name spaces. Its meaning is expected to be
%   standardized at some future point, at which point those documents
%   using the colon for experimental purposes may need to be updated.
%   (There is no guarantee that any name-space mechanism adopted for XML
%   will in fact use the colon as a name-space delimiter.) In practice,
%   this means that authors should not use the colon in XML names except
%   as part of name-space experiments, but that XML processors should
%   accept the colon as a name character.
%   
%   An Nmtoken (name token) is any mixture of name characters.
%   
%   Names and Tokens
%   [4]  NameChar ::= Letter | Digit | '.' | '-' | '_' | ':'

%  2.4 Character Data and Markup
%  
%   Text consists of intermingled character data and markup. Markup takes
%   the form of start-tags, end-tags, empty-element tags, entity
%   references, character references, comments, CDATA section delimiters,
%   document type declarations, and processing instructions.
%   
%   All text that is not markup constitutes the character data of the
%   document.
%   
%   The ampersand character (&) and the left angle bracket (<) may appear
%   in their literal form only when used as markup delimiters, or within a
%   comment, a processing instruction, or a CDATA section. They are also
%   legal within the literal entity value of an internal entity
%   declaration; see "4.3.2 Well-Formed Parsed Entities". If they are
%   needed elsewhere, they must be escaped using either numeric character
%   references or the strings "&amp;" and "&lt;" respectively. The right
%   angle bracket (>) may be represented using the string "&gt;", and
%   must, for compatibility, be escaped using "&gt;" or a character
%   reference when it appears in the string "]]>" in content, when that
%   string is not marking the end of a CDATA section.
%   
%   In the content of elements, character data is any string of characters
%   which does not contain the start-delimiter of any markup. In a CDATA
%   section, character data is any string of characters not including the
%   CDATA-section-close delimiter, "]]>".
%   
%   To allow attribute values to contain both single and double quotes,
%   the apostrophe or single-quote character (') may be represented as
%   "&apos;", and the double-quote character (") as "&quot;".
%   
%   Character Data
%   [14]  CharData ::= [^<&]* - ([^<&]* ']]>' [^<&]*)

:- pred charData(pstate(_), pstate(ref(doc.content))).
:- mode charData(in, out) is det.

charData -->
    plus(except([('<'), ('&')]) or charRef)
    				    then (pred(Chars::in, pdi, puo) is det -->
    mkString(Chars, Data),
    add(data(Data), Ref),
    return(Ref)
    ).

%   
%  2.5 Comments
%  
%   Comments may appear anywhere in a document outside other markup; in
%   addition, they may appear within the document type declaration at
%   places allowed by the grammar. They are not part of the document's
%   character data; an XML processor may, but need not, make it possible
%   for an application to retrieve the text of comments. For
%   compatibility, the string "--" (double-hyphen) must not occur within
%   comments.
%   
%   Comments
%   [15]  Comment ::= '<!--' ((Char - '-') | ('-' (Char - '-')))* '-->'

:- pred comment(pstate(_), pstate(ref(doc.content))).
:- mode comment(in, out) is det.

    mkString(Cs, Comment),
    add(comment(Comment), Ref),
    return(Ref)
    )).

%   An example of a comment:

%   <!-- declarations for <head> & <body> -->
%   
%  2.6 Processing Instructions
%  
%   Processing instructions (PIs) allow documents to contain instructions
%   for applications.
%   
%   Processing Instructions
%   [16]  PI ::= '<?' PITarget (S (Char* - (Char* '?>' Char*)))? '?>'

:- pred pi(pstate(_), pstate(ref(doc.content))).

    opt(s and upto(char, lit("?>")))
    				    then (pred(MD::in, pdi, puo) is det -->
    ( { MD = yes((_, (Chars, _))) } ->
	mkString(Chars, Data)
    ;
        { Data = "" }
    ),
    add(pi(Target, Data), Ref),
    return(Ref)
    ))).

%   [17]  PITarget ::= Name - (('X' | 'x') ('M' | 'm') ('L' | 'l'))

:- pred piTarget(pstate(_), pstate(name)).
:- mode piTarget(in, out) is det.

piTarget -->
    name			    then (pred(Target::in, pdi, puo) is det -->
    ( { Target = "XML" ; Target = "xml" } ->
    	fail("(x|X)(m|M)(l|L) is not a valid pi target")
    ;
    	return(Target)
    )).

%   
%   PIs are not part of the document's character data, but must be passed
%   through to the application. The PI begins with a target (PITarget)
%   used to identify the application to which the instruction is directed.
%   The target names "XML", "xml", and so on are reserved for
%   standardization in this or future versions of this specification. The
%   XML Notation mechanism may be used for formal declaration of PI
%   targets.
%   
%  2.7 CDATA Sections
%  
%   CDATA sections may occur anywhere character data may occur; they are
%   used to escape blocks of text containing characters which would
%   otherwise be recognized as markup. CDATA sections begin with the
%   string "<![CDATA[" and end with the string "]]>":
%   
%   CDATA Sections
%   [18]  CDSect ::= CDStart CData CDEnd
%   [19]  CDStart ::= '<![CDATA['
%   [20]  CData ::= (Char* - (Char* ']]>' Char*))
%   [21]  CDEnd ::= ']]>'

:- pred cdSect(pstate(_), pstate(ref(doc.content))).
:- mode cdSect(in, out) is det.

cdSect -->
    lit("<![CDATA[")		    then (pred(_::in, pdi, puo) is det -->
    upto(char, lit("]]>", unit))    then (pred((Cs, _)::in, pdi, puo) is det -->
    mkString(Cs, Data),
    add(data(Data), Ref),
    return(Ref)
    )).

%   
%   Within a CDATA section, only the CDEnd string is recognized as markup,
%   so that left angle brackets and ampersands may occur in their literal
%   form; they need not (and cannot) be escaped using "&lt;" and "&amp;".
%   CDATA sections cannot nest.
%   
%   An example of a CDATA section, in which "<greeting>" and "</greeting>"
%   are recognized as character data, not markup:
%   
%   <![CDATA[<greeting>Hello, world!</greeting>]]>
%   
%  2.8 Prolog and Document Type Declaration
%  
%   XML documents may, and should, begin with an XML declaration which
%   specifies the version of XML being used. For example, the following is
%   a complete XML document, well-formed but not valid:
%   
%   <?xml version="1.0"?>
%   <greeting>Hello, world!</greeting>
%   
%   and so is this:
%   
%   <greeting>Hello, world!</greeting>
%   
%   The version number "1.0" should be used to indicate conformance to
%   this version of this specification; it is an error for a document to
%   use the value "1.0" if it does not conform to this version of this
%   specification. It is the intent of the XML working group to give later
%   versions of this specification numbers other than "1.0", but this
%   intent does not indicate a commitment to produce any future versions
%   of XML, nor if any are produced, to use any particular numbering
%   scheme. Since future versions are not ruled out, this construct is
%   provided as a means to allow the possibility of automatic version
%   recognition, should it become necessary. Processors may signal an
%   error if they receive documents labeled with versions they do not
%   support.
%   
%   The function of the markup in an XML document is to describe its
%   storage and logical structure and to associate attribute-value pairs
%   with its logical structures. XML provides a mechanism, the document
%   type declaration, to define constraints on the logical structure and
%   to support the use of predefined storage units. An XML document is
%   valid if it has an associated document type declaration and if the
%   document complies with the constraints expressed in it.
%   
%   The document type declaration must appear before the first element in
%   the document.
%

%   
%   The XML document type declaration contains or points to markup
%   declarations that provide a grammar for a class of documents. This
%   grammar is known as a document type definition, or DTD. The document
%   type declaration can point to an external subset (a special kind of
%   external entity) containing markup declarations, or can contain the
%   markup declarations directly in an internal subset, or can do both.
%   The DTD for a document consists of both subsets taken together.
%   
%   A markup declaration is an element type declaration, an attribute-list
%   declaration, an entity declaration, or a notation declaration. These
%   declarations may be contained in whole or in part within parameter
%   entities, as described in the well-formedness and validity constraints

%   
%   Validity Constraint: Root Element Type
%   The Name in the document type declaration must match the element type
%   of the root element.
%   
%   Validity Constraint: Proper Declaration/PE Nesting
%   Parameter-entity replacement text must be properly nested with markup
%   declarations. That is to say, if either the first character or the
%   last character of a markup declaration (markupdecl above) is contained
%   in the replacement text for a parameter-entity reference, both must be
%   contained in the same replacement text.
%   
%   Well-Formedness Constraint: PEs in Internal Subset
%   In the internal DTD subset, parameter-entity references can occur only
%   where markup declarations can occur, not within markup declarations.
%   (This does not apply to references that occur in external parameter
%   entities or to the external subset.)
%   
%   Like the internal subset, the external subset and any external
%   parameter entities referred to in the DTD must consist of a series of
%   complete markup declarations of the types allowed by the non-terminal
%   symbol markupdecl, interspersed with white space or parameter-entity
%   references. However, portions of the contents of the external subset
%   or of external parameter entities may conditionally be ignored by
%   using the conditional section construct; this is not allowed in the

    return
    ).

%   
%   The external subset and external parameter entities also differ from
%   the internal subset in that in them, parameter-entity references are
%   permitted within markup declarations, not only between markup
%   declarations.
%   
%   An example of an XML document with a document type declaration:
%   
%   <?xml version="1.0"?>
%   <!DOCTYPE greeting SYSTEM "hello.dtd">
%   <greeting>Hello, world!</greeting>
%   
%   The system identifier "hello.dtd" gives the URI of a DTD for the
%   document.
%   
%   The declarations can also be given locally, as in this example:
%   
%   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
%   <!DOCTYPE greeting [
%     <!ELEMENT greeting (#PCDATA)>
%   ]>
%   <greeting>Hello, world!</greeting>
%   
%   If both the external and internal subsets are used, the internal
%   subset is considered to occur before the external subset. This has the
%   effect that entity and attribute-list declarations in the internal
%   subset take precedence over those in the external subset.
%   
%  2.9 Standalone Document Declaration
%  
%   Markup declarations can affect the content of the document, as passed
%   from an XML processor to an application; examples are attribute
%   defaults and entity declarations. The standalone document declaration,
%   which may appear as a component of the XML declaration, signals
%   whether or not there are such declarations which appear external to
%   the document entity.
%   
%   Standalone Document Declaration
%   [32]  SDDecl ::= S 'standalone' Eq (("'" ('yes' | 'no') "'") | ('"'
%   ('yes' | 'no') '"')) [ VC: Standalone Document Declaration ]

:- pred sdDecl(pstate(_), pstate(unit)).

    lit("standalone")		    then (pred(_::in, pdi, puo) is det -->
    eq				    then (pred(_::in, pdi, puo) is det -->
    quote			    then (pred(Q::in, pdi, puo) is det -->
    (lit("yes") or lit("no"))	    then (pred(_::in, pdi, puo) is det -->
    quote			    then (pred(EndQ::in, pdi, puo) is det -->
    ( { Q = EndQ } ->
    	return
    ;
    	error("mismatched quotes")
    ))))))).

%   
%   In a standalone document declaration, the value "yes" indicates that
%   there are no markup declarations external to the document entity
%   (either in the DTD external subset, or in an external parameter entity
%   referenced from the internal subset) which affect the information
%   passed from the XML processor to the application. The value "no"
%   indicates that there are or may be such external markup declarations.
%   Note that the standalone document declaration only denotes the
%   presence of external declarations; the presence, in a document, of
%   references to external entities, when those entities are internally
%   declared, does not change its standalone status.
%   
%   If there are no external markup declarations, the standalone document
%   declaration has no meaning. If there are external markup declarations
%   but there is no standalone document declaration, the value "no" is
%   assumed.
%   
%   Any XML document for which standalone="no" holds can be converted
%   algorithmically to a standalone document, which may be desirable for
%   some network delivery applications.
%   
%   Validity Constraint: Standalone Document Declaration
%   The standalone document declaration must have the value "no" if any
%   external markup declarations contain declarations of:
%     * attributes with default values, if elements to which these
%       attributes apply appear in the document without specifications of
%       values for these attributes, or
%     * entities (other than amp, lt, gt, apos, quot), if references to
%       those entities appear in the document, or
%     * attributes with values subject to normalization, where the
%       attribute appears in the document with a value which will change
%       as a result of normalization, or
%     * element types with element content, if white space occurs directly
%       within any instance of those types.
%       
%   An example XML declaration with a standalone document declaration:
%   
%   <?xml version="1.0" standalone='yes'?>
%   
%  2.10 White Space Handling
%  
%   In editing XML documents, it is often convenient to use "white space"
%   (spaces, tabs, and blank lines, denoted by the nonterminal S in this
%   specification) to set apart the markup for greater readability. Such
%   white space is typically not intended for inclusion in the delivered
%   version of the document. On the other hand, "significant" white space
%   that should be preserved in the delivered version is common, for
%   example in poetry and source code.
%   
%   An XML processor must always pass all characters in a document that
%   are not markup through to the application. A validating XML processor
%   must also inform the application which of these characters constitute
%   white space appearing in element content.
%   
%   A special attribute named xml:space may be attached to an element to
%   signal an intention that in that element, white space should be
%   preserved by applications. In valid documents, this attribute, like
%   any other, must be declared if it is used. When declared, it must be
%   given as an enumerated type whose only possible values are "default"
%   and "preserve". For example:
%   
%       <!ATTLIST poem   xml:space (default|preserve) 'preserve'>
%   
%   The value "default" signals that applications' default white-space
%   processing modes are acceptable for this element; the value "preserve"
%   indicates the intent that applications preserve all the white space.
%   This declared intent is considered to apply to all elements within the
%   content of the element where it is specified, unless overriden with
%   another instance of the xml:space attribute.
%   
%   The root element of any document is considered to have signaled no
%   intentions as regards application space handling, unless it provides a
%   value for this attribute or the attribute is declared with a default
%   value.
%   
%  2.11 End-of-Line Handling
%  
%   XML parsed entities are often stored in computer files which, for
%   editing convenience, are organized into lines. These lines are
%   typically separated by some combination of the characters
%   carriage-return (#xD) and line-feed (#xA).
%   
%   To simplify the tasks of applications, wherever an external parsed
%   entity or the literal entity value of an internal parsed entity
%   contains either the literal two-character sequence "#xD#xA" or a
%   standalone literal #xD, an XML processor must pass to the application
%   the single character #xA. (This behavior can conveniently be produced
%   by normalizing all line breaks to #xA on input, before parsing.)
%   
%  2.12 Language Identification
%  
%   In document processing, it is often useful to identify the natural or
%   formal language in which the content is written. A special attribute
%   named xml:lang may be inserted in documents to specify the language
%   used in the contents and attribute values of any element in an XML
%   document. In valid documents, this attribute, like any other, must be
%   declared if it is used. The values of the attribute are language
%   identifiers as defined by [IETF RFC 1766], "Tags for the
%   Identification of Languages":
%

%   
%   The Langcode may be any of the following:
%     * a two-letter language code as defined by [ISO 639], "Codes for the
%       representation of names of languages"
%     * a language identifier registered with the Internet Assigned
%       Numbers Authority [IANA]; these begin with the prefix "i-" (or
%       "I-")
%     * a language identifier assigned by the user, or agreed on between
%       parties in private use; these must begin with the prefix "x-" or
%       "X-" in order to ensure that they do not conflict with names later
%       standardized or registered with IANA
%       
%   There may be any number of Subcode segments; if the first subcode
%   segment exists and the Subcode consists of two letters, then it must
%   be a country code from [ISO 3166], "Codes for the representation of
%   names of countries." If the first subcode consists of more than two
%   letters, it must be a subcode for the language in question registered
%   with IANA, unless the Langcode begins with the prefix "x-" or "X-".
%   
%   It is customary to give the language code in lower case, and the
%   country code (if any) in upper case. Note that these values, unlike
%   other names in XML documents, are case insensitive.
%   
%   For example:
%   
%   <p xml:lang="en">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</p>
%   <p xml:lang="en-GB">What colour is it?</p>
%   <p xml:lang="en-US">What color is it?</p>
%   <sp who="Faust" desc='leise' xml:lang="de">
%     <l>Habe nun, ach! Philosophie,</l>
%     <l>Juristerei, und Medizin</l>
%     <l>und leider auch Theologie</l>
%     <l>durchaus studiert mit heißem Bemüh'n.</l>
%     </sp>
%   
%   The intent declared with xml:lang is considered to apply to all
%   attributes and content of the element where it is specified, unless
%   overridden with an instance of xml:lang on another element within that
%   content.
%   
%   A simple declaration for xml:lang might take the form
%   
%   xml:lang  NMTOKEN  #IMPLIED
%   
%   but specific default values may also be given, if appropriate. In a
%   collection of French poems for English students, with glosses and
%   notes in English, the xml:lang attribute might be declared this way:
%   
%       <!ATTLIST poem   xml:lang NMTOKEN 'fr'>
%       <!ATTLIST gloss  xml:lang NMTOKEN 'en'>
%       <!ATTLIST note   xml:lang NMTOKEN 'en'>
%   
%3. Logical Structures
%
%   Each XML document contains one or more elements, the boundaries of
%   which are either delimited by start-tags and end-tags, or, for empty
%   elements, by an empty-element tag. Each element has a type, identified
%   by name, sometimes called its "generic identifier" (GI), and may have
%   a set of attribute specifications. Each attribute specification has a
%   name and a value.

%   for standardization in this or future versions of this specification.
%   
%   Well-Formedness Constraint: Element Type Match
%   The Name in an element's end-tag must match the element type in the
%   start-tag.
%   
%   Validity Constraint: Element Valid
%   An element is valid if there is a declaration matching elementdecl
%   where the Name matches the element type, and one of the following
%   holds:
%    1. The declaration matches EMPTY and the element has no content.
%    2. The declaration matches children and the sequence of child
%       elements belongs to the language generated by the regular
%       expression in the content model, with optional white space
%       (characters matching the nonterminal S) between each pair of child
%       elements.
%    3. The declaration matches Mixed and the content consists of
%       character data and child elements whose types match names in the
%       content model.
%    4. The declaration matches ANY, and the types of any child elements
%       have been declared.

%  3.2 Element Type Declarations
%  
%   The element structure of an XML document may, for validation purposes,
%   be constrained using element type and attribute-list declarations. An
%   element type declaration constrains the element's content.
%   
%   Element type declarations often constrain which element types can
%   appear as children of the element. At user option, an XML processor
%   may issue a warning when a declaration mentions an element type for
%   which no declaration is provided, but this is not an error.
%   
%   An element type declaration takes the form:
%   
%   Element Type Declaration
%   [45]  elementdecl ::= '<!ELEMENT' S Name S contentspec S? '>' [ VC:
%   Unique Element Type Declaration ]

%   where the Name gives the element type being declared.
%   
%   Validity Constraint: Unique Element Type Declaration
%   No element type may be declared more than once.
%   
%   Examples of element type declarations:

%    3.2.1 Element Content
%    
%   An element type has element content when elements of that type must
%   contain only child elements (no character data), optionally separated
%   by white space (characters matching the nonterminal S). In this case,
%   the constraint includes a content model, a simple grammar governing
%   the allowed types of the child elements and the order in which they
%   are allowed to appear. The grammar is built on content particles
%   (cps), which consist of names, choice lists of content particles, or
%   sequence lists of content particles:

%   Any content particle in a choice list may appear in the element
%   content at the location where the choice list appears in the grammar;
%   content particles occurring in a sequence list must each appear in the

%   following a name or list governs whether the element or the content
%   particles in the list may occur one or more (+), zero or more (*), or
%   zero or one times (?). The absence of such an operator means that the
%   element or content particle must appear exactly once. This syntax and
%   meaning are identical to those used in the productions in this
%   specification.
%   
%   The content of an element matches a content model if and only if it is
%   possible to trace out a path through the content model, obeying the
%   sequence, choice, and repetition operators and matching each element
%   in the content against an element type in the content model. For

%   Validity Constraint: Proper Group/PE Nesting
%   Parameter-entity replacement text must be properly nested with
%   parenthetized groups. That is to say, if either of the opening or
%   closing parentheses in a choice, seq, or Mixed construct is contained
%   in the replacement text for a parameter entity, both must be contained
%   in the same replacement text. For interoperability, if a
%   parameter-entity reference appears in a choice, seq, or Mixed
%   construct, its replacement text should not be empty, and neither the
%   first nor last non-blank character of the replacement text should be a
%   connector (| or ,).
%   
%   Examples of element-content models:

%   <!ELEMENT spec (front, body, back?)>

%   An element type has mixed content when elements of that type may
%   contain character data, optionally interspersed with child elements.

%   not their order or their number of occurrences:

%  3.3 Attribute-List Declarations
%  
%   Attributes are used to associate name-value pairs with elements.
%   Attribute specifications may appear only within start-tags and
%   empty-element tags; thus, the productions used to recognize them
%   appear in "3.1 Start-Tags, End-Tags, and Empty-Element Tags".
%   Attribute-list declarations may be used:
%     * To define the set of attributes pertaining to a given element
%       type.
%     * To establish type constraints for these attributes.
%     * To provide default values for attributes.
%       
%   Attribute-list declarations specify the name, data type, and default
%   value (if any) of each attribute associated with a given element type:

%   
%   The Name in the AttlistDecl rule is the type of an element. At user
%   option, an XML processor may issue a warning if attributes are

%   error. The Name in the AttDef rule is the name of the attribute.
%   
%   When more than one AttlistDecl is provided for a given element type,
%   the contents of all those provided are merged. When more than one
%   definition is provided for the same attribute of a given element type,
%   the first declaration is binding and later declarations are ignored.
%   For interoperability, writers of DTDs may choose to provide at most
%   one attribute-list declaration for a given element type, at most one
%   attribute definition for a given attribute name, and at least one
%   attribute definition in each attribute-list declaration. For
%   interoperability, an XML processor may at user option issue a warning
%   when more than one attribute-list declaration is provided for a given
%   element type, or more than one attribute definition is provided for a
%   given attribute, but this is not an error.
%   
%    3.3.1 Attribute Types
%    
%   XML attribute types are of three kinds: a string type, a set of
%   tokenized types, and enumerated types. The string type may take any
%   literal string as a value; the tokenized types have varying lexical
%   and semantic constraints, as noted:
%   
%   Attribute Types

    lit("ENTITY", entity) or lit("ENTITIES", entities) or
    lit("NMTOKENS", nmtokens) or lit("NMTOKEN", nmtoken).

%   
%   Validity Constraint: ID
%   Values of type ID must match the Name production. A name must not
%   appear more than once in an XML document as a value of this type;
%   i.e., ID values must uniquely identify the elements which bear them.
%   
%   Validity Constraint: One ID per Element Type
%   No element type may have more than one ID attribute specified.
%   
%   Validity Constraint: ID Attribute Default
%   An ID attribute must have a declared default of #IMPLIED or #REQUIRED.
%   
%   Validity Constraint: IDREF
%   Values of type IDREF must match the Name production, and values of
%   type IDREFS must match Names; each Name must match the value of an ID
%   attribute on some element in the XML document; i.e. IDREF values must
%   match the value of some ID attribute.
%   
%   Validity Constraint: Entity Name
%   Values of type ENTITY must match the Name production, values of type
%   ENTITIES must match Names; each Name must match the name of an
%   unparsed entity declared in the DTD.
%   
%   Validity Constraint: Name Token
%   Values of type NMTOKEN must match the Nmtoken production; values of
%   type NMTOKENS must match Nmtokens.
%   
%   Enumerated attributes can take one of a list of values provided in the
%   declaration. There are two kinds of enumerated types:
%   
%   Enumerated Attribute Types

%   
%   A NOTATION attribute identifies a notation, declared in the DTD with
%   associated system and/or public identifiers, to be used in
%   interpreting the element to which the attribute is attached.
%   
%   Validity Constraint: Notation Attributes
%   Values of this type must match one of the notation names included in
%   the declaration; all notation names in the declaration must be
%   declared.
%   
%   Validity Constraint: Enumeration
%   Values of this type must match one of the Nmtoken tokens in the
%   declaration.
%   
%   For interoperability, the same Nmtoken should not occur more than once
%   in the enumerated attribute types of a single element type.
%   
%    3.3.2 Attribute Defaults
%    
%   An attribute declaration provides information on whether the
%   attribute's presence is required, and if not, how an XML processor
%   should react if a declared attribute is absent in a document.
%   
%   Attribute Defaults
%   [60]  DefaultDecl ::= '#REQUIRED' | '#IMPLIED'
%   | (('#FIXED' S)? AttValue) [ VC: Required Attribute ]
%   [ VC: Attribute Default Legal ]
%   [ WFC: No < in Attribute Values ]
%   [ VC: Fixed Attribute Default ]

:- pred defaultDecl(pstate(_), pstate(default)).
:- mode defaultDecl(in, out) is det.

defaultDecl -->
    lit("#REQUIRED", required) or
    lit("#IMPLIED", implied) or
    wrap(snd((lit("#FIXED", unit) and s) and attValue), wrapFixed) or
    wrap(attValue, wrapDefault).

:- mode wrapFixed(in, out) is det.

wrapFixed(AttValue, fixed(AttValue)).

:- pred wrapDefault(string, default).
:- mode wrapDefault(in, out) is det.

wrapDefault(AttValue, defaulted(AttValue)).

%   
%   In an attribute declaration, #REQUIRED means that the attribute must
%   always be provided, #IMPLIED that no default value is provided. If the
%   declaration is neither #REQUIRED nor #IMPLIED, then the AttValue value
%   contains the declared default value; the #FIXED keyword states that
%   the attribute must always have the default value. If a default value
%   is declared, when an XML processor encounters an omitted attribute, it
%   is to behave as though the attribute were present with the declared
%   default value.
%   
%   Validity Constraint: Required Attribute
%   If the default declaration is the keyword #REQUIRED, then the
%   attribute must be specified for all elements of the type in the
%   attribute-list declaration.
%   
%   Validity Constraint: Attribute Default Legal
%   The declared default value must meet the lexical constraints of the
%   declared attribute type.
%   
%   Validity Constraint: Fixed Attribute Default
%   If an attribute has a default value declared with the #FIXED keyword,
%   instances of that attribute must match the default value.
%   
%   Examples of attribute-list declarations:
%   
%   <!ATTLIST termdef
%             id      ID      #REQUIRED
%             name    CDATA   #IMPLIED>
%   <!ATTLIST list
%             type    (bullets|ordered|glossary)  "ordered">
%   <!ATTLIST form
%             method  CDATA   #FIXED "POST">
%   
%    3.3.3 Attribute-Value Normalization
%    
%   Before the value of an attribute is passed to the application or
%   checked for validity, the XML processor must normalize it as follows:
%     * a character reference is processed by appending the referenced
%       character to the attribute value
%     * an entity reference is processed by recursively processing the
%       replacement text of the entity
%     * a whitespace character (#x20, #xD, #xA, #x9) is processed by
%       appending #x20 to the normalized value, except that only a single
%       #x20 is appended for a "#xD#xA" sequence that is part of an
%       external parsed entity or the literal entity value of an internal
%       parsed entity
%     * other characters are processed by appending them to the normalized
%       value
%       
%   If the declared value is not CDATA, then the XML processor must
%   further process the normalized attribute value by discarding any
%   leading and trailing space (#x20) characters, and by replacing
%   sequences of space (#x20) characters by a single space (#x20)
%   character.
%   
%   All attributes for which no declaration has been read should be
%   treated by a non-validating parser as if declared CDATA.
%   
%  3.4 Conditional Sections
%  
%   Conditional sections are portions of the document type declaration
%   external subset which are included in, or excluded from, the logical
%   structure of the DTD based on the keyword which governs them.

    				    then (pred(P::in, pdi, puo) is det -->
    { P = (_Ign, Terminal) },
    return(Terminal)
    ).

%   
%   Like the internal and external DTD subsets, a conditional section may
%   contain one or more complete declarations, comments, processing
%   instructions, or nested conditional sections, intermingled with white
%   space.
%   
%   If the keyword of the conditional section is INCLUDE, then the
%   contents of the conditional section are part of the DTD. If the
%   keyword of the conditional section is IGNORE, then the contents of the
%   conditional section are not logically part of the DTD. Note that for
%   reliable parsing, the contents of even ignored conditional sections
%   must be read in order to detect nested conditional sections and ensure
%   that the end of the outermost (ignored) conditional section is
%   properly detected. If a conditional section with a keyword of INCLUDE
%   occurs within a larger conditional section with a keyword of IGNORE,
%   both the outer and the inner conditional sections are ignored.
%   
%   If the keyword of the conditional section is a parameter-entity
%   reference, the parameter entity must be replaced by its content before
%   the processor decides whether to include or ignore the conditional
%   section.
%   
%   An example:
%   
%   <!ENTITY % draft 'INCLUDE' >
%   <!ENTITY % final 'IGNORE' >
%   
%   <![%draft;[
%   <!ELEMENT book (comments*, title, body, supplements?)>
%   ]]>
%   <![%final;[
%   <!ELEMENT book (title, body, supplements?)>
%   ]]>
%   
%4. Physical Structures
%
%   An XML document may consist of one or many storage units. These are
%   called entities; they all have content and are all (except for the
%   document entity, see below, and the external DTD subset) identified by
%   name. Each XML document has one entity called the document entity,
%   which serves as the starting point for the XML processor and may
%   contain the whole document.
%   
%   Entities may be either parsed or unparsed. A parsed entity's contents
%   are referred to as its replacement text; this text is considered an
%   integral part of the document.
%   
%   An unparsed entity is a resource whose contents may or may not be
%   text, and if text, may not be XML. Each unparsed entity has an
%   associated notation, identified by name. Beyond a requirement that an
%   XML processor make the identifiers for the entity and notation
%   available to the application, XML places no constraints on the
%   contents of unparsed entities.
%   
%   Parsed entities are invoked by name using entity references; unparsed
%   entities by name, given in the value of ENTITY or ENTITIES attributes.
%   
%   General entities are entities for use within the document content. In
%   this specification, general entities are sometimes referred to with
%   the unqualified term entity when this leads to no ambiguity. Parameter
%   entities are parsed entities for use within the DTD. These two types
%   of entities use different forms of reference and are recognized in
%   different contexts. Furthermore, they occupy different namespaces; a
%   parameter entity and a general entity with the same name are two
%   distinct entities.

%  4.1 Character and Entity References
%  
%   A character reference refers to a specific character in the ISO/IEC

%   Well-Formedness Constraint: Legal Character
%   Characters referred to using character references must match the
%   production for Char.
%   If the character reference begins with "&#x", the digits and letters
%   up to the terminating ; provide a hexadecimal representation of the
%   character's code point in ISO/IEC 10646. If it begins just with "&#",
%   the digits up to the terminating ; provide a decimal representation of
%   the character's code point.
%   
%   An entity reference refers to the content of a named entity.
%   References to parsed general entities use ampersand (&) and semicolon
%   (;) as delimiters. Parameter-entity references use percent-sign (%)
%   and semicolon (;) as delimiters.

%   
%   Well-Formedness Constraint: Entity Declared
%   In a document without any DTD, a document with only an internal DTD
%   subset which contains no parameter entity references, or a document
%   with "standalone='yes'", the Name given in the entity reference must
%   match that in an entity declaration, except that well-formed
%   documents need not declare any of the following entities: amp, lt, gt,
%   apos, quot. The declaration of a parameter entity must precede any
%   reference to it. Similarly, the declaration of a general entity must
%   precede any reference to it which appears in a default value in an
%   attribute-list declaration. Note that if entities are declared in the
%   external subset or in external parameter entities, a non-validating
%   processor is not obligated to read and process their declarations; for
%   such documents, the rule that an entity must be declared is a
%   well-formedness constraint only if standalone='yes'.
%   
%   Validity Constraint: Entity Declared
%   In a document with an external subset or external parameter entities
%   with "standalone='no'", the Name given in the entity reference must
%   match that in an entity declaration. For interoperability, valid
%   documents should declare the entities amp, lt, gt, apos, quot, in the
%   form specified in "4.6 Predefined Entities". The declaration of a
%   parameter entity must precede any reference to it. Similarly, the
%   declaration of a general entity must precede any reference to it which
%   appears in a default value in an attribute-list declaration.
%   
%   Well-Formedness Constraint: Parsed Entity
%   An entity reference must not contain the name of an unparsed entity.
%   Unparsed entities may be referred to only in attribute values declared
%   to be of type ENTITY or ENTITIES.
%   
%   Well-Formedness Constraint: No Recursion
%   A parsed entity must not contain a recursive reference to itself,
%   either directly or indirectly.
%   
%   Well-Formedness Constraint: In DTD
%   Parameter-entity references may only appear in the DTD.
%   
%   Examples of character and entity references:

%   
%   The Name identifies the entity in an entity reference or, in the case
%   of an unparsed entity, in the value of an ENTITY or ENTITIES
%   attribute. If the same entity is declared more than once, the first
%   declaration encountered is binding; at user option, an XML processor
%   may issue a warning if entities are declared multiple times.
%   
%    4.2.1 Internal Entities
%    
%   If the entity definition is an EntityValue, the defined entity is
%   called an internal entity. There is no separate physical storage
%   object, and the content of the entity is given in the declaration.
%   Note that some processing of entity and character references in the
%   literal entity value may be required to produce the correct
%   replacement text: see "4.5 Construction of Internal Entity
%   Replacement Text".
%   
%   An internal entity is a parsed entity.
%   
%   Example of an internal entity declaration:
%   
%   <!ENTITY Pub-Status "This is a pre-release of the
%    specification.">
%   
%    4.2.2 External Entities
%    
%   If the entity is not internal, it is an external entity, declared as
%   follows:
%   
%   External Entity Declaration
%   [75]  ExternalID ::= 'SYSTEM' S SystemLiteral
%   | 'PUBLIC' S PubidLiteral S SystemLiteral

:- pred externalID(pstate(_), pstate(externalId)).

    wrap(snd((lit("PUBLIC", unit) and s) and pubidLiteral) and
           snd(s and systemLiteral), wrapPublic).

:- pred wrapSystem(string, externalId).
:- mode wrapSystem(in, out) is det.

wrapSystem(System, system(System)).

:- pred wrapPublic((string, string), externalId).
:- mode wrapPublic(in, out) is det.

wrapPublic((Public, System), public(Public, System)).

%   [76]  NDataDecl ::= S 'NDATA' S Name [ VC: Notation Declared ]

:- pred nDataDecl(pstate(_), pstate(name)).
:- mode nDataDecl(in, out) is det.

nDataDecl -->
    s				    then (pred(_::in, pdi, puo) is det -->
    lit("NDATA")		    then (pred(_::in, pdi, puo) is det -->
    s				    then (pred(_::in, pdi, puo) is det -->
    name			    then (pred(Name::in, pdi, puo) is det -->
    return(Name)
    )))).


%   
%   If the NDataDecl is present, this is a general unparsed entity;
%   otherwise it is a parsed entity.
%   
%   Validity Constraint: Notation Declared
%   The Name must match the declared name of a notation.
%   
%   The SystemLiteral is called the entity's system identifier. It is a
%   URI, which may be used to retrieve the entity. Note that the hash mark
%   (#) and fragment identifier frequently used with URIs are not,
%   formally, part of the URI itself; an XML processor may signal an error
%   if a fragment identifier is given as part of a system identifier.
%   Unless otherwise provided by information outside the scope of this
%   specification (e.g. a special XML element type defined by a particular
%   DTD, or a processing instruction defined by a particular application
%   specification), relative URIs are relative to the location of the
%   resource within which the entity declaration occurs. A URI might thus
%   be relative to the document entity, to the entity containing the
%   external DTD subset, or to some other external parameter entity.
%   
%   An XML processor should handle a non-ASCII character in a URI by
%   representing the character in UTF-8 as one or more bytes, and then
%   escaping these bytes with the URI escaping mechanism (i.e., by
%   converting each byte to %HH, where HH is the hexadecimal notation of
%   the byte value).
%   
%   In addition to a system identifier, an external identifier may include
%   a public identifier. An XML processor attempting to retrieve the
%   entity's content may use the public identifier to try to generate an
%   alternative URI. If the processor is unable to do so, it must use the
%   URI specified in the system literal. Before a match is attempted, all
%   strings of white space in the public identifier must be normalized to
%   single space characters (#x20), and leading and trailing white space
%   must be removed.
%   
%   Examples of external entity declarations:
%   
%   <!ENTITY open-hatch
%            SYSTEM "http://www.textuality.com/boilerplate/OpenHatch.xml">
%   <!ENTITY open-hatch
%            PUBLIC "-//Textuality//TEXT Standard open-hatch boilerplate//

%            "http://www.textuality.com/boilerplate/OpenHatch.xml">

%            NDATA gif >
%   
%  4.3 Parsed Entities
%  
%    4.3.1 The Text Declaration
%    
%   External parsed entities may each begin with a text declaration.
%   
%   Text Declaration
%   [77]  TextDecl ::= '<?xml' VersionInfo? EncodingDecl S? '?>'

:- pred textDecl(pstate(_), pstate(unit)).
:- mode textDecl(in, out) is det.

textDecl -->
    lit("<?xml")		    then (pred(_::in, pdi, puo) is det -->
    opt(versionInfo)		    then (pred(_::in, pdi, puo) is det -->
    encodingDecl		    then (pred(EncName::in, pdi, puo) is det -->
    opt(s)			    then (pred(_::in, pdi, puo) is det -->
    lit("?>")			    then (pred(_::in, pdi, puo) is det -->
    get(gEncodings, encodings(Encodings)),
    ( { search(Encodings, EncName, Enc) } ->
        setEncoding(Enc),
	return
    ;
    	{ format("unknown encoding `%s' in external entity",
		[s(EncName)], Msg) },
	error(Msg)
    )))))).

%   
%   The text declaration must be provided literally, not by reference to a
%   parsed entity. No text declaration may appear at any position other
%   than the beginning of an external parsed entity.
%   
%    4.3.2 Well-Formed Parsed Entities
%    
%   The document entity is well-formed if it matches the production
%   labeled document. An external general parsed entity is well-formed if
%   it matches the production labeled extParsedEnt. An external parameter
%   entity is well-formed if it matches the production labeled extPE.
%   
%   Well-Formed External Parsed Entity
%   [78]  extParsedEnt ::= TextDecl? content

:- pred extParsedEnt(pstate(_), pstate(list(ref(doc.content)))).
:- mode extParsedEnt(in, out) is det.

extParsedEnt -->
    snd(opt(textDecl) and content).

%   [79]  extPE ::= TextDecl? extSubsetDecl

:- pred extPE(pstate(_), pstate(unit)).
:- mode extPE(in, out) is det.

extPE -->
    opt(textDecl)		    then (pred(_::in, pdi, puo) is det -->
    extSubsetDecl		    then (pred(_::in, pdi, puo) is det -->
    return
    )).

%   
%   An internal general parsed entity is well-formed if its replacement
%   text matches the production labeled content. All internal parameter
%   entities are well-formed by definition.
%   
%   A consequence of well-formedness in entities is that the logical and
%   physical structures in an XML document are properly nested; no
%   start-tag, end-tag, empty-element tag, element, comment, processing
%   instruction, character reference, or entity reference can begin in one
%   entity and end in another.
%   
%    4.3.3 Character Encoding in Entities
%    
%   Each external parsed entity in an XML document may use a different
%   encoding for its characters. All XML processors must be able to read
%   entities in either UTF-8 or UTF-16.
%   
%   Entities encoded in UTF-16 must begin with the Byte Order Mark
%   described by ISO/IEC 10646 Annex E and Unicode Appendix B (the ZERO
%   WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE character, #xFEFF). This is an encoding
%   signature, not part of either the markup or the character data of the
%   XML document. XML processors must be able to use this character to
%   differentiate between UTF-8 and UTF-16 encoded documents.
%   
%   Although an XML processor is required to read only entities in the
%   UTF-8 and UTF-16 encodings, it is recognized that other encodings are
%   used around the world, and it may be desired for XML processors to
%   read entities that use them. Parsed entities which are stored in an
%   encoding other than UTF-8 or UTF-16 must begin with a text declaration
%   containing an encoding declaration:
%   
%   Encoding Declaration
%   [80]  EncodingDecl ::= S 'encoding' Eq ('"' EncName '"' |  "'" EncName
%   "'" )

:- pred encodingDecl(pstate(_), pstate(string)).

    quote			    then (pred(EndQ::in, pdi, puo) is det -->
    ( { Q = EndQ } ->
    	return(Name)
    ;
    	error("mismatched quotes")
    ))))))).

%   [81]  EncName ::= [A-Za-z] ([A-Za-z0-9._] | '-')* /* Encoding name
%   contains only Latin characters */

:- pred encName(pstate(_), pstate(string)).
:- mode encName(in, out) is det.

encName -->
    (range('A', 'Z') or range('a', 'z'))
    				    then (pred(C::in, pdi, puo) is det --> 
    star(range('A', 'Z') or range('a', 'z') or range('0', '9') or
         lit1('.') or lit1('_') or lit1('-'))
				    then (pred(Cs::in, pdi, puo) is det --> 
    mkString([C|Cs], EncName),
    return(EncName)
    )).

%   
%   In the document entity, the encoding declaration is part of the XML
%   declaration. The EncName is the name of the encoding used.
%   
%   In an encoding declaration, the values "UTF-8", "UTF-16",
%   "ISO-10646-UCS-2", and "ISO-10646-UCS-4" should be used for the
%   various encodings and transformations of Unicode / ISO/IEC 10646, the
%   values "ISO-8859-1", "ISO-8859-2", ... "ISO-8859-9" should be used for
%   the parts of ISO 8859, and the values "ISO-2022-JP", "Shift_JIS", and
%   "EUC-JP" should be used for the various encoded forms of JIS
%   X-0208-1997. XML processors may recognize other encodings; it is
%   recommended that character encodings registered (as charsets) with the
%   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority [IANA], other than those just
%   listed, should be referred to using their registered names. Note that
%   these registered names are defined to be case-insensitive, so
%   processors wishing to match against them should do so in a
%   case-insensitive way.
%   
%   In the absence of information provided by an external transport
%   protocol (e.g. HTTP or MIME), it is an error for an entity including
%   an encoding declaration to be presented to the XML processor in an
%   encoding other than that named in the declaration, for an encoding
%   declaration to occur other than at the beginning of an external
%   entity, or for an entity which begins with neither a Byte Order Mark
%   nor an encoding declaration to use an encoding other than UTF-8. Note
%   that since ASCII is a subset of UTF-8, ordinary ASCII entities do not
%   strictly need an encoding declaration.
%   
%   It is a fatal error when an XML processor encounters an entity with an
%   encoding that it is unable to process.
%   
%   Examples of encoding declarations:
%   
%   <?xml encoding='UTF-8'?>
%   <?xml encoding='EUC-JP'?>
%   
%  4.4 XML Processor Treatment of Entities and References
%  
%   The table below summarizes the contexts in which character references,
%   entity references, and invocations of unparsed entities might appear
%   and the required behavior of an XML processor in each case. The labels
%   in the leftmost column describe the recognition context:
%   
%   Reference in Content
%          as a reference anywhere after the start-tag and before the
%          end-tag of an element; corresponds to the nonterminal content.
%

%    4.4.1 Not Recognized
%    
%   Outside the DTD, the % character has no special significance; thus,
%   what would be parameter entity references in the DTD are not
%   recognized as markup in content. Similarly, the names of unparsed
%   entities are not recognized except when they appear in the value of an
%   appropriately declared attribute.
%   
%    4.4.2 Included
%    
%   An entity is included when its replacement text is retrieved and
%   processed, in place of the reference itself, as though it were part of
%   the document at the location the reference was recognized. The
%   replacement text may contain both character data and (except for
%   parameter entities) markup, which must be recognized in the usual way,
%   except that the replacement text of entities used to escape markup
%   delimiters (the entities amp, lt, gt, apos, quot) is always treated as
%   data. (The string "AT&amp;T;" expands to "AT&T;" and the remaining
%   ampersand is not recognized as an entity-reference delimiter.) A
%   character reference is included when the indicated character is
%   processed in place of the reference itself.
%   
%    4.4.3 Included If Validating
%    
%   When an XML processor recognizes a reference to a parsed entity, in
%   order to validate the document, the processor must include its
%   replacement text. If the entity is external, and the processor is not
%   attempting to validate the XML document, the processor may, but need
%   not, include the entity's replacement text. If a non-validating parser
%   does not include the replacement text, it must inform the application
%   that it recognized, but did not read, the entity.
%   
%   This rule is based on the recognition that the automatic inclusion
%   provided by the SGML and XML entity mechanism, primarily designed to
%   support modularity in authoring, is not necessarily appropriate for
%   other applications, in particular document browsing. Browsers, for
%   example, when encountering an external parsed entity reference, might
%   choose to provide a visual indication of the entity's presence and
%   retrieve it for display only on demand.
%   
%    4.4.4 Forbidden
%    
%   The following are forbidden, and constitute fatal errors:
%     * the appearance of a reference to an unparsed entity.
%     * the appearance of any character or general-entity reference in the
%       DTD except within an EntityValue or AttValue.
%     * a reference to an external entity in an attribute value.
%       
%    4.4.5 Included in Literal
%    
%   When an entity reference appears in an attribute value, or a parameter
%   entity reference appears in a literal entity value, its replacement
%   text is processed in place of the reference itself as though it were
%   part of the document at the location the reference was recognized,
%   except that a single or double quote character in the replacement text
%   is always treated as a normal data character and will not terminate
%   the literal. For example, this is well-formed:
%   
%   <!ENTITY % YN '"Yes"' >
%   <!ENTITY WhatHeSaid "He said &YN;" >
%   
%   while this is not:
%   
%   <!ENTITY EndAttr "27'" >
%   <element attribute='a-&EndAttr;>
%   
%    4.4.6 Notify
%    
%   When the name of an unparsed entity appears as a token in the value of
%   an attribute of declared type ENTITY or ENTITIES, a validating
%   processor must inform the application of the system and public (if
%   any) identifiers for both the entity and its associated notation.
%   
%    4.4.7 Bypassed
%    
%   When a general entity reference appears in the EntityValue in an
%   entity declaration, it is bypassed and left as is.
%   
%    4.4.8 Included as PE
%    
%   Just as with external parsed entities, parameter entities need only be
%   included if validating. When a parameter-entity reference is
%   recognized in the DTD and included, its replacement text is enlarged
%   by the attachment of one leading and one following space (#x20)
%   character; the intent is to constrain the replacement text of
%   parameter entities to contain an integral number of grammatical tokens
%   in the DTD.
%   
%  4.5 Construction of Internal Entity Replacement Text
%  
%   In discussing the treatment of internal entities, it is useful to
%   distinguish two forms of the entity's value. The literal entity value
%   is the quoted string actually present in the entity declaration,
%   corresponding to the non-terminal EntityValue. The replacement text is
%   the content of the entity, after replacement of character references
%   and parameter-entity references.
%   
%   The literal entity value as given in an internal entity declaration
%   (EntityValue) may contain character, parameter-entity, and
%   general-entity references. Such references must be contained entirely
%   within the literal entity value. The actual replacement text that is
%   included as described above must contain the replacement text of any
%   parameter entities referred to, and must contain the character
%   referred to, in place of any character references in the literal
%   entity value; however, general-entity references must be left as-is,
%   unexpanded. For example, given the following declarations:
%   
%   <!ENTITY % pub    "&#xc9;ditions Gallimard" >
%   <!ENTITY   rights "All rights reserved" >
%   <!ENTITY   book   "La Peste: Albert Camus,
%   &#xA9; 1947 %pub;. &rights;" >
%   
%   then the replacement text for the entity "book" is:
%   
%   La Peste: Albert Camus,
%   © 1947 Éditions Gallimard. &rights;
%   
%   The general-entity reference "&rights;" would be expanded should the
%   reference "&book;" appear in the document's content or an attribute
%   value.
%   
%   These simple rules may have complex interactions; for a detailed
%   discussion of a difficult example, see "D. Expansion of Entity and
%   Character References".
%   
%  4.6 Predefined Entities
%  
%   Entity and character references can both be used to escape the left
%   angle bracket, ampersand, and other delimiters. A set of general
%   entities (amp, lt, gt, apos, quot) is specified for this purpose.
%   Numeric character references may also be used; they are expanded
%   immediately when recognized and must be treated as character data, so
%   the numeric character references "&#60;" and "&#38;" may be used to
%   escape < and & when they occur in character data.
%   
%   All XML processors must recognize these entities whether they are
%   declared or not. For interoperability, valid XML documents should
%   declare these entities, like any others, before using them. If the
%   entities in question are declared, they must be declared as internal
%   entities whose replacement text is the single character being escaped
%   or a character reference to that character, as shown below.
%   
%   <!ENTITY lt     "&#38;#60;">
%   <!ENTITY gt     "&#62;">
%   <!ENTITY amp    "&#38;#38;">
%   <!ENTITY apos   "&#39;">
%   <!ENTITY quot   "&#34;">
%   
%   Note that the < and & characters in the declarations of "lt" and "amp"
%   are doubly escaped to meet the requirement that entity replacement be
%   well-formed.
%   
%  4.7 Notation Declarations
%  
%   Notations identify by name the format of unparsed entities, the format
%   of elements which bear a notation attribute, or the application to
%   which a processing instruction is addressed.
%   
%   Notation declarations provide a name for the notation, for use in
%   entity and attribute-list declarations and in attribute
%   specifications, and an external identifier for the notation which may
%   allow an XML processor or its client application to locate a helper
%   application capable of processing data in the given notation.
%   
%   Notation Declarations
%   [82]  NotationDecl ::= '<!NOTATION' S Name S (ExternalID |  PublicID)
%   S? '>'

:- pred notationDecl(pstate(_), pstate(unit)).
:- mode notationDecl(in, out) is det.

notationDecl -->
    lit("<!NOTATION")		    then (pred(_::in, pdi, puo) is det -->
    s				    then (pred(_::in, pdi, puo) is det -->
    name			    then (pred(_::in, pdi, puo) is det -->
    s				    then (pred(_::in, pdi, puo) is det -->
    (externalID or publicID)	    then (pred(_::in, pdi, puo) is det -->
    opt(s)			    then (pred(_::in, pdi, puo) is det -->
    lit1('>')			    then (pred(_::in, pdi, puo) is det -->
    return
    ))))))).

%   [83]  PublicID ::= 'PUBLIC' S PubidLiteral

:- pred publicID(pstate(_), pstate(externalId)).
:- mode publicID(in, out) is det.

publicID -->
    lit("PUBLIC")		    then (pred(_::in, pdi, puo) is det -->
    s				    then (pred(_::in, pdi, puo) is det -->
    pubidLiteral		    then (pred(Lit::in, pdi, puo) is det -->
    return(public(Lit, ""))
    ))).

%   
%   XML processors must provide applications with the name and external
%   identifier(s) of any notation declared and referred to in an attribute
%   value, attribute definition, or entity declaration. They may
%   additionally resolve the external identifier into the system
%   identifier, file name, or other information needed to allow the
%   application to call a processor for data in the notation described.
%   (It is not an error, however, for XML documents to declare and refer
%   to notations for which notation-specific applications are not
%   available on the system where the XML processor or application is
%   running.)
%   
%  4.8 Document Entity
%  
%   The document entity serves as the root of the entity tree and a
%   starting-point for an XML processor. This specification does not
%   specify how the document entity is to be located by an XML processor;
%   unlike other entities, the document entity has no name and might well
%   appear on a processor input stream without any identification at all.
%   
%5. Conformance
%
%  5.1 Validating and Non-Validating Processors
%  
%   Conforming XML processors fall into two classes: validating and
%   non-validating.
%   
%   Validating and non-validating processors alike must report violations
%   of this specification's well-formedness constraints in the content of
%   the document entity and any other parsed entities that they read.
%   
%   Validating processors must report violations of the constraints
%   expressed by the declarations in the DTD, and failures to fulfill the
%   validity constraints given in this specification. To accomplish this,
%   validating XML processors must read and process the entire DTD and all
%   external parsed entities referenced in the document.
%   
%   Non-validating processors are required to check only the document
%   entity, including the entire internal DTD subset, for well-formedness.
%   While they are not required to check the document for validity, they
%   are required to process all the declarations they read in the internal
%   DTD subset and in any parameter entity that they read, up to the first
%   reference to a parameter entity that they do not read; that is to say,
%   they must use the information in those declarations to normalize
%   attribute values, include the replacement text of internal entities,
%   and supply default attribute values. They must not process entity
%   declarations or attribute-list declarations encountered after a
%   reference to a parameter entity that is not read, since the entity may
%   have contained overriding declarations.
%   
%  5.2 Using XML Processors
%  
%   The behavior of a validating XML processor is highly predictable; it
%   must read every piece of a document and report all well-formedness and
%   validity violations. Less is required of a non-validating processor;
%   it need not read any part of the document other than the document
%   entity. This has two effects that may be important to users of XML
%   processors:
%     * Certain well-formedness errors, specifically those that require
%       reading external entities, may not be detected by a non-validating
%       processor. Examples include the constraints entitled Entity
%       Declared, Parsed Entity, and No Recursion, as well as some of the
%       cases described as forbidden in "4.4 XML Processor Treatment of
%       Entities and References".
%     * The information passed from the processor to the application may
%       vary, depending on whether the processor reads parameter and
%       external entities. For example, a non-validating processor may not
%       normalize attribute values, include the replacement text of
%       internal entities, or supply default attribute values, where doing
%       so depends on having read declarations in external or parameter
%       entities.
%       
%   For maximum reliability in interoperating between different XML
%   processors, applications which use non-validating processors should
%   not rely on any behaviors not required of such processors.
%   Applications which require facilities such as the use of default
%   attributes or internal entities which are declared in external
%   entities should use validating XML processors.
%   
%6. Notation
%
%   The formal grammar of XML is given in this specification using a
%   simple Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) notation. Each rule in the
%   grammar defines one symbol, in the form
%   
%   symbol ::= expression
%   
%   Symbols are written with an initial capital letter if they are defined
%   by a regular expression, or with an initial lower case letter
%   otherwise. Literal strings are quoted.
%   
%   Within the expression on the right-hand side of a rule, the following
%   expressions are used to match strings of one or more characters:
%   
%   #xN
%          where N is a hexadecimal integer, the expression matches the
%          character in ISO/IEC 10646 whose canonical (UCS-4) code value,
%          when interpreted as an unsigned binary number, has the value
%          indicated. The number of leading zeros in the #xN form is
%          insignificant; the number of leading zeros in the corresponding
%          code value is governed by the character encoding in use and is
%          not significant for XML.
%          
%   [a-zA-Z], [#xN-#xN]
%          matches any character with a value in the range(s) indicated
%          (inclusive).
%          
%   [^a-z], [^#xN-#xN]
%          matches any character with a value outside the range indicated.
%          
%   [^abc], [^#xN#xN#xN]
%          matches any character with a value not among the characters
%          given.
%          
%   "string"
%          matches a literal string matching that given inside the double
%          quotes.
%          
%   'string'
%          matches a literal string matching that given inside the single
%          quotes.
%          
%   These symbols may be combined to match more complex patterns as
%   follows, where A and B represent simple expressions:
%   
%   (expression)
%          expression is treated as a unit and may be combined as
%          described in this list.
%          
%   A?
%          matches A or nothing; optional A.
%          
%   A B
%          matches A followed by B.
%          
%   A | B
%          matches A or B but not both.
%          
%   A - B
%          matches any string that matches A but does not match B.
%          
%   A+
%          matches one or more occurrences of A.
%          
%   A*
%          matches zero or more occurrences of A.
%          
%   Other notations used in the productions are:
%   
%   /* ... */
%          comment.
%          
%   [ wfc: ... ]
%          well-formedness constraint; this identifies by name a
%          constraint on well-formed documents associated with a
%          production.
%          
%   [ vc: ... ]
%          validity constraint; this identifies by name a constraint on
%          valid documents associated with a production.

%C. XML and SGML (Non-Normative)
%

%D. Expansion of Entity and Character References (Non-Normative)
%
%   This appendix contains some examples illustrating the sequence of
%   entity- and character-reference recognition and expansion, as
%   specified in "4.4 XML Processor Treatment of Entities and References".
%   
%   If the DTD contains the declaration
%   
%   <!ENTITY example "<p>An ampersand (&#38;#38;) may be escaped
%   numerically (&#38;#38;#38;) or with a general entity
%   (&amp;amp;).</p>" >
%   
%   then the XML processor will recognize the character references when it
%   parses the entity declaration, and resolve them before storing the
%   following string as the value of the entity "example":
%   
%   <p>An ampersand (&#38;) may be escaped
%   numerically (&#38;#38;) or with a general entity
%   (&amp;amp;).</p>
%   
%   A reference in the document to "&example;" will cause the text to be
%   reparsed, at which time the start- and end-tags of the "p" element
%   will be recognized and the three references will be recognized and
%   expanded, resulting in a "p" element with the following content (all
%   data, no delimiters or markup):
%   
%   An ampersand (&) may be escaped
%   numerically (&#38;) or with a general entity
%   (&amp;).
%   
%   A more complex example will illustrate the rules and their effects
%   fully. In the following example, the line numbers are solely for
%   reference.
%   
%   1 <?xml version='1.0'?>
%   2 <!DOCTYPE test [
%   3 <!ELEMENT test (#PCDATA) >
%   4 <!ENTITY % xx '&#37;zz;'>
%   5 <!ENTITY % zz '&#60;!ENTITY tricky "error-prone" >' >
%   6 %xx;
%   7 ]>
%   8 <test>This sample shows a &tricky; method.</test>
%   
%   This produces the following:
%     * in line 4, the reference to character 37 is expanded immediately,
%       and the parameter entity "xx" is stored in the symbol table with
%       the value "%zz;". Since the replacement text is not rescanned, the
%       reference to parameter entity "zz" is not recognized. (And it
%       would be an error if it were, since "zz" is not yet declared.)
%     * in line 5, the character reference "&#60;" is expanded immediately
%       and the parameter entity "zz" is stored with the replacement text
%       "<!ENTITY tricky "error-prone" >", which is a well-formed entity
%       declaration.
%     * in line 6, the reference to "xx" is recognized, and the
%       replacement text of "xx" (namely "%zz;") is parsed. The reference
%       to "zz" is recognized in its turn, and its replacement text
%       ("<!ENTITY tricky "error-prone" >") is parsed. The general entity
%       "tricky" has now been declared, with the replacement text
%       "error-prone".
%     * in line 8, the reference to the general entity "tricky" is
%       recognized, and it is expanded, so the full content of the "test"
%       element is the self-describing (and ungrammatical) string This
%       sample shows a error-prone method.
%       
%E. Deterministic Content Models (Non-Normative)
%
%   For compatibility, it is required that content models in element type
%   declarations be deterministic.
%   
%   SGML requires deterministic content models (it calls them
%   "unambiguous"); XML processors built using SGML systems may flag
%   non-deterministic content models as errors.
%   
%   For example, the content model ((b, c) | (b, d)) is non-deterministic,
%   because given an initial b the parser cannot know which b in the model
%   is being matched without looking ahead to see which element follows
%   the b. In this case, the two references to b can be collapsed into a
%   single reference, making the model read (b, (c | d)). An initial b now
%   clearly matches only a single name in the content model. The parser
%   doesn't need to look ahead to see what follows; either c or d would be
%   accepted.
%   
%   More formally: a finite state automaton may be constructed from the
%   content model using the standard algorithms, e.g. algorithm 3.5 in
%   section 3.9 of Aho, Sethi, and Ullman [Aho/Ullman]. In many such
%   algorithms, a follow set is constructed for each position in the
%   regular expression (i.e., each leaf node in the syntax tree for the
%   regular expression); if any position has a follow set in which more
%   than one following position is labeled with the same element type
%   name, then the content model is in error and may be reported as an
%   error.
%   
%   Algorithms exist which allow many but not all non-deterministic
%   content models to be reduced automatically to equivalent deterministic
%   models; see Brüggemann-Klein 1991 [Brüggemann-Klein].
%   
%F. Autodetection of Character Encodings (Non-Normative)
%
%   The XML encoding declaration functions as an internal label on each
%   entity, indicating which character encoding is in use. Before an XML
%   processor can read the internal label, however, it apparently has to
%   know what character encoding is in use--which is what the internal
%   label is trying to indicate. In the general case, this is a hopeless
%   situation. It is not entirely hopeless in XML, however, because XML
%   limits the general case in two ways: each implementation is assumed to
%   support only a finite set of character encodings, and the XML encoding
%   declaration is restricted in position and content in order to make it
%   feasible to autodetect the character encoding in use in each entity in
%   normal cases. Also, in many cases other sources of information are
%   available in addition to the XML data stream itself. Two cases may be
%   distinguished, depending on whether the XML entity is presented to the
%   processor without, or with, any accompanying (external) information.
%   We consider the first case first.
%   
%   Because each XML entity not in UTF-8 or UTF-16 format must begin with
%   an XML encoding declaration, in which the first characters must be
%   '<?xml', any conforming processor can detect, after two to four octets
%   of input, which of the following cases apply. In reading this list, it
%   may help to know that in UCS-4, '<' is "#x0000003C" and '?' is
%   "#x0000003F", and the Byte Order Mark required of UTF-16 data streams
%   is "#xFEFF".
%   
%     * 00 00 00 3C: UCS-4, big-endian machine (1234 order)
%     * 3C 00 00 00: UCS-4, little-endian machine (4321 order)
%     * 00 00 3C 00: UCS-4, unusual octet order (2143)
%     * 00 3C 00 00: UCS-4, unusual octet order (3412)
%     * FE FF: UTF-16, big-endian
%     * FF FE: UTF-16, little-endian
%     * 00 3C 00 3F: UTF-16, big-endian, no Byte Order Mark (and thus,
%       strictly speaking, in error)
%     * 3C 00 3F 00: UTF-16, little-endian, no Byte Order Mark (and thus,
%       strictly speaking, in error)
%     * 3C 3F 78 6D: UTF-8, ISO 646, ASCII, some part of ISO 8859,
%       Shift-JIS, EUC, or any other 7-bit, 8-bit, or mixed-width encoding
%       which ensures that the characters of ASCII have their normal
%       positions, width, and values; the actual encoding declaration must
%       be read to detect which of these applies, but since all of these
%       encodings use the same bit patterns for the ASCII characters, the
%       encoding declaration itself may be read reliably
%     * 4C 6F A7 94: EBCDIC (in some flavor; the full encoding declaration
%       must be read to tell which code page is in use)
%     * other: UTF-8 without an encoding declaration, or else the data
%       stream is corrupt, fragmentary, or enclosed in a wrapper of some
%       kind
%       
%   This level of autodetection is enough to read the XML encoding
%   declaration and parse the character-encoding identifier, which is
%   still necessary to distinguish the individual members of each family
%   of encodings (e.g. to tell UTF-8 from 8859, and the parts of 8859 from
%   each other, or to distinguish the specific EBCDIC code page in use,
%   and so on).
%   
%   Because the contents of the encoding declaration are restricted to
%   ASCII characters, a processor can reliably read the entire encoding
%   declaration as soon as it has detected which family of encodings is in
%   use. Since in practice, all widely used character encodings fall into
%   one of the categories above, the XML encoding declaration allows
%   reasonably reliable in-band labeling of character encodings, even when
%   external sources of information at the operating-system or
%   transport-protocol level are unreliable.
%   
%   Once the processor has detected the character encoding in use, it can
%   act appropriately, whether by invoking a separate input routine for
%   each case, or by calling the proper conversion function on each
%   character of input.
%   
%   Like any self-labeling system, the XML encoding declaration will not
%   work if any software changes the entity's character set or encoding
%   without updating the encoding declaration. Implementors of
%   character-encoding routines should be careful to ensure the accuracy
%   of the internal and external information used to label the entity.
%   
%   The second possible case occurs when the XML entity is accompanied by
%   encoding information, as in some file systems and some network
%   protocols. When multiple sources of information are available, their
%   relative priority and the preferred method of handling conflict should
%   be specified as part of the higher-level protocol used to deliver XML.
%   Rules for the relative priority of the internal label and the
%   MIME-type label in an external header, for example, should be part of
%   the RFC document defining the text/xml and application/xml MIME types.
%   In the interests of interoperability, however, the following rules are
%   recommended.
%     * If an XML entity is in a file, the Byte-Order Mark and
%       encoding-declaration PI are used (if present) to determine the
%       character encoding. All other heuristics and sources of
%       information are solely for error recovery.
%     * If an XML entity is delivered with a MIME type of text/xml, then
%       the charset parameter on the MIME type determines the character
%       encoding method; all other heuristics and sources of information
%       are solely for error recovery.
%     * If an XML entity is delivered with a MIME type of application/xml,
%       then the Byte-Order Mark and encoding-declaration PI are used (if
%       present) to determine the character encoding. All other heuristics
%       and sources of information are solely for error recovery.
%       
%   These rules apply only in the absence of protocol-level documentation;
%   in particular, when the MIME types text/xml and application/xml are
%   defined, the recommendations of the relevant RFC will supersede these
%   rules.
