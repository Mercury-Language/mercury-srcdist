This directory contains stuff for accessing POSIX.3 stuff directly from
Mercury. Since I don't actually have a copy of the standard, it's more
like the stuff that man pages claim is in POSIX.3, and not even all of
that. :-) conway, 12/10/99

Note that on some systems, it may be necessary to link with additional
libraries.  This can be done by setting the variable MLLIBS in the Mmakefile,
e.g.

	MLLIBS = -lsocket -lnsl
