mdprof_cgid is a minimal server that accepts and passes through requests to
the deep profiler CGI program, mdprof_cgi.  It's useful when you want to view
deep profiling data without configuring and running a proper web server.

Building
--------

After building the posix library in the parent directory,

    mmake depend
    mmake


Starting
--------

    ./mdprof_cgid --host localhost --port 8081 --mdprof mdprof \
	--script-name /cgi-bin/mdprof_cgi

The default values for options are shown.

The --mdprof option specifies the location of the `mdprof' executable.
If it is in the path then the default setting should be fine.
Since `mdprof' is just a wrapper script around `mdprof_cgi' you can also pass
the location of `mdprof_cgi' directly instead.

The --script-name option specifies the virtual path under which the deep
profiler will be accessible.  This server ignores all requests except to that
virtual path.


Using
-----

Once the server is running, point the browser to your deep profiling data,
e.g.

    firefox http://localhost:8081/cgi-bin/mdprof_cgi?/path/to/Deep.data

Note that running instances of mdprof_cgi won't be automatically killed when
mdprof_cgid is terminated.
