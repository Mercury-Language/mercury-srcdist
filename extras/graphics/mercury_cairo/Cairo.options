# This file contains system-specific information about where to install the
# Mercury cairo binding and how to compile and link it against the cairo
# itself.  If your system has the pkg-config tool then you can use that as
# shown below to find the necessary information.

# NOTE: the current values of CAIRO_CFLAGS and CAIRO_LDFLAGS are for the
# MacPorts (<http://www.macports.org/> port of cairo on Mac OS X.
# They will probably not work on other systems.

# Where are we going to install the Mercury cairo binding?

INSTALL_PREFIX=.

# What flags do we need to pass to the C compiler in order to compile
# against cairo?  
# Use "pkg-config --cflags cairo" to determine this and substitute the result
# as the value of CAIRO_CFLAGS.
#
CAIRO_CFLAGS="-I/opt/local/include/cairo -I/opt/local/include/pixman-1 -I/opt/local/include -I/opt/local/include/freetype2 -I/opt/local/include/libpng12"

# What flags do we need to pass to the linker in order to link against cairo?
# Use "pkg-config --libs cairo" here and substitute the result as the value
# of CAIRO_LDFLAGS.

CAIRO_LDFLAGS="-L/opt/local/lib -lcairo -lpixman-1 -lfontconfig -lexpat -liconv -lfreetype -lpng12 -lz -lXrender -lX11 -lxcb -lXau -lXdmcp"
