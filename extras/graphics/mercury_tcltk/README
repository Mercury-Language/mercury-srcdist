This directory contains the package `mercury_tcltk', which is a Mercury
binding for Tcl/Tk. You will need the Mercury compiler to build
it (see <http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/mercury> to find out more about Mercury).
You will also need Tcl/Tk 4.0 or later installed on your system.

It contains the following modules:
	mtcltk.m        - a binding to Tcl/Tk (Tk 4.0 or later)
	mtk.m           - a layer on top of mtcltk making it
			  easier to create and manipulate Tk
			  widgets.

See HOWTO for details on how to link the package in with your own
Mercury programs.

To build the Tcl/Tk binding on MacOSX see Mmakefile.MacOSX.
