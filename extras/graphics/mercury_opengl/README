This directory contains the package `mercury_opengl', which is a Mercury
binding for OpenGL.

For `mercury_opengl', you will need:
	- the Mercury system
	- an OpenGL implementation such as Mesa.

In order to use it you will also need some way for your program to
create and manage rendering contexts.  The Mercury GLUT binding provides
one such way and Mercury Allegro binding provides another; both of these
bindings are available as part of the Mercury extras distribution.

This directory contains the following files:
	
	mglu.m	- provides Mercury bindings to (some of) the GLU library.
	mogl.m	- provides Mercury bindings to (some of) Open GL 1.1

See the file Mmakefile for instructions on how to build the OpenGL binding.
The file Mmakefile.MacOSX contains instructions on how to build the binding
on systems with MacOS X.

See HOWTO for details on how to link the package in with your own
Mercury programs.
