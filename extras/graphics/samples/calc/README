A simple calculator using the Mercury Tcl/Tk binding.

Before building this example you will need to build
the Tcl/Tk binding in ../mercury_tcltk.

To compile the example on Linux do:
mmake depend
mmake

To compile the example on Mac OS X:

If you built the mercury_tcltk library on Mac OS X, but haven't installed it,
then do:
mmake -f Mmakefile.MacOSX depend
mmake -f Mmakefile.MacOSX
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=../../mercury_tcltk

If you installed the mercury_tcltk library on Mac OS X, 
then you will need to use the following command to build the example:
mmc calc -lmercury_tcltk
