To make moose more useful:
	- allow parsing actions to be semidet to allow the imposition
	  of semantic conditions during parsing.
	- add error productions to produce nice error messages.

Cosmetic improvements:
	- handle errors in the input better by faking declarations for
	  undeclared productions; faking a clause for declared nonterminals
	  with no clauses ; faking declarations and a clause (eg A -> epsilon)
	  for nonterminals that get used but have no clauses and no
	  declaration.

	- provide the ability to dump a list of the terminal symbols.

	- make the various dumps go to files other than the .m file.
	
Wish list:
	- introduce new nonterminals for disjunctions in productions.
	  This is quite difficult because it requires correct computation
	  of the nonlocal variables of goals (including all the nasty
	  cases like pred expressions).

	- Implement the groovey PDA algorithms suggested by Andrew.

	- compile away the tables.
