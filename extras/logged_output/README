This directory shows how you can use the MercuryFile structure to change
the behaviour of io.m.

The file logged_output.m implements an io__output_stream which writes to
stdout and also logs all of its output to a file at the same time.

To compile this module you need a mercury compiler which has has been
configured with --enable-new-mercuryfile-struct.
