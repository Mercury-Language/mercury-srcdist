Mercury Syntax Highlighting Under Vim 6.0+

1. Create a diretory `~/.vim':

    $ mkdir ~/.vim

2. Copy everything recursively from this directory into `~/.vim':

    $ cp -r . ~/.vim

3. Ensure you have the following lines in your `~/.vimrc' file:

    filetype on
    filetype plugin on
    syntax enable

4. It is advisable to have the following file encoding detection lines
in your ~/.vimrc:

    if has("multi_byte")
      set encoding=utf-8
      setglobal fileencoding=utf-8
      if &termencoding == ""
        let &termencoding = &encoding
      endif
    endif

5. Optionally enable modeline detection.  This configures vim to use the
"vim:" lines at the beginning of some source files to configure settings
local to that file.

    set modeline

6. If you wish to change the colour scheme used by Vim's syntax highlighting,
we suggest you put the necessary commands in `~/.vim/colors/mycolours.vim'
and append the following to the above list of commands in your `~/.vimrc':

    colors mycolours

7. Vim will load `~/.vim/syntax/mercury.vim' and `~/.vim/ftplugin/mercury.vim'
automatically when opening a .m or .moo file.

The syntax file describes two options you may wish to alter from your
`~/.vimrc' file.

The ftplugin file defines a number of useful keyboard mappings you may wish to
consider.

If you want to add a custom extension for Mercury source files, then modify the
ftdetect/mercury.vim file. Currently .m and .moo are recognised.
