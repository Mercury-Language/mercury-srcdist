% In the unification in the condition of the if-then-else, the variable
% List has an inst which includes `any' components.  Normally, we can't
% check whether `any' has become further instantiated over a goal so we
% do not allow it in a negated context.  However, in this case, the
% `any' component is unified with `free' so we know that it cannot have
% become further instantiated.  Therefore we should allow the
% unification in the condition.
