% This test case exposes a bug in the interaction of solver types and
% sub-modules in rotd-2005-09-06 and before.  The problem was that the
% sub-modules were reading in the solver type declarations from the .int0 files
% and adding the foreign_procs for the representation and intialisation
% functions.
% (The test case is from Peter Hawkins.)
