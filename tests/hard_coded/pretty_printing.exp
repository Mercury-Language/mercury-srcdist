In Xanadu did 
Kubla Khan A 
stately 
pleasure-dome 
decree: Where 
Alph, the sacred 
river, ran Through 
caverns 
measureless to man 
Down to a sunless 
sea. So twice five 
miles of fertile 
ground With walls 
and towers were 
girdled round: And 
here were gardens 
bright with 
sinuous rills 
Where blossomed 
many an 
incense-bearing 
tree; And here 
were forests 
ancient as the 
hills, Enfolding 
sunny spots of 
greenery. But oh! 
that deep romantic 
chasm which 
slanted Down the 
green hill athwart 
a cedarn cover! A 
savage place! as 
holy and enchanted 
As e'er beneath a 
waning moon was 
haunted By woman 
wailing for her 
demon-lover!

And here were gardens bright with sinuous rills Where blossomed many an 
incense-bearing tree; And here were forests ancient as the hills, Enfolding

the green hill athwart a cedarn cover! A savage place! as holy and enchanted 
As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted By woman wailing for her demon-lover!
