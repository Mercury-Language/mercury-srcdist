% This is a regression test. Some versions of the compiler abort on this code.
%
% The bug that this test case tests for is described by this comment from
% liveness.m:
%
% If a variable is not live on entry to a goal, but the goal gives it a value,
% the code of this module assumes that
%
% (a) any parallel goals also give it a value, or
% (b) the variable is local to this goal and hence does not occur in parallel
%     goals.
%
% If a variable occurs in the nonlocal set of the goal, the code of this
% assumes that (b) is not true, and will therefore require (a) to be true.
% If some of the parallel goals cannot succeed, the first pass will include
% the variable in their post-birth sets.
%
% If a variable occurs in the nonlocal set of the goal, but is actually
% local to the goal, then any occurrence of that variable in the postbirth
% sets of parallel goals will lead to an inconsistency, because the variable
% will not die on those parallel paths, but will die on the path that
% actually gives a value to the variable.
