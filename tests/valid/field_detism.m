% According to the rules in the language reference manual,
% this example is not currently valid.  But this behaviour
% is a bit unexpected for the programmer, so it would be
% nice if the language was changed so that it was valid.

% See <http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/research/mercury/mailing-lists/mercury-reviews/
% mercury-reviews.0312/0189.html> for more details.

% XXX Perhaps this test should not go in tests/valid,
% since it is not yet valid under the current Mercury language rules.
