fundeps_unbound_in_ctor.m:008:   error in type class constraints: type variable
fundeps_unbound_in_ctor.m:008:   `C' occurs in the constraints, but is not
fundeps_unbound_in_ctor.m:008:   determined by the constructor's argument

fundeps_unbound_in_ctor.m:008:   All types occurring in typeclass constraints
fundeps_unbound_in_ctor.m:008:   must be fully determined. A type is fully
fundeps_unbound_in_ctor.m:008:   determined if one of the following holds:
fundeps_unbound_in_ctor.m:008:   1) All type variables occurring in the type
fundeps_unbound_in_ctor.m:008:   are determined.
fundeps_unbound_in_ctor.m:008:   2) The type occurs in a constraint argument,
fundeps_unbound_in_ctor.m:008:   that argument is in the range of some
fundeps_unbound_in_ctor.m:008:   functional dependency for that class, and the
fundeps_unbound_in_ctor.m:008:   types in all of the domain arguments for that
fundeps_unbound_in_ctor.m:008:   functional dependency are fully determined.
fundeps_unbound_in_ctor.m:008:   A type variable is determined if one of the
fundeps_unbound_in_ctor.m:008:   following holds:
fundeps_unbound_in_ctor.m:008:   1) The type variable occurs in the argument
fundeps_unbound_in_ctor.m:008:   types of the predicate, function, or
fundeps_unbound_in_ctor.m:008:   constructor which is constrained.
fundeps_unbound_in_ctor.m:008:   2) The type variable occurs in a type which is
fundeps_unbound_in_ctor.m:008:   fully determined.
fundeps_unbound_in_ctor.m:008:   See the "Functional dependencies" section of
fundeps_unbound_in_ctor.m:008:   the reference manual for details.
fundeps_unbound_in_ctor.m:012: Error: type variable C in class constraints,
fundeps_unbound_in_ctor.m:012:   which was introduced with `=>' must be
