assert_in_interface.m:012: In interface for module `assert_in_interface':
assert_in_interface.m:012:   error: exported promise refers to predicate
assert_in_interface.m:012:   `list.last'/2, which is defined in another module,
assert_in_interface.m:012:   `list'.
assert_in_interface.m:012:   Either move the promise into the implementation
assert_in_interface.m:012:   section, or move it to the `list' module. In most
assert_in_interface.m:012:   cases, the latter is preferable.
