loopcheck.m:009:   Declared `det', inferred `erroneous'.
loopcheck.m:016: Error: `:- pragma loop_check' declaration not allowed for
loopcheck.m:016:   procedure with determinism `erroneous'.
loopcheck.m:016:   The pragma requested is only valid for the following
loopcheck.m:016:   determinisms: cc_multi, cc_nondet, det, multi, nondet and
loopcheck.m:016:   semidet.
loopcheck.m:017: Warning: recursive call will lead to infinite recursion.
loopcheck.m:017:   If this recursive call is executed, the procedure will call
loopcheck.m:017:   itself with exactly the same input arguments, leading to
loopcheck.m:017:   infinite recursion.
