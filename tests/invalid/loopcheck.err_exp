loopcheck.m:011:   warning: determinism declaration could be tighter.
loopcheck.m:011:   Declared `det', inferred `erroneous'.
loopcheck.m:020: Error: `:- pragma loop_check' declaration not allowed for
loopcheck.m:020:   procedure with determinism `erroneous'.
loopcheck.m:020:   The pragma requested is only valid for the following
loopcheck.m:020:   determinisms: cc_multi, cc_nondet, det, multi, nondet and
loopcheck.m:020:   semidet.
loopcheck.m:022: Warning: recursive call to predicate `loop'/1 will lead to
loopcheck.m:022:   infinite recursion.
loopcheck.m:022:   If this recursive call is executed, the procedure will call
loopcheck.m:022:   itself with exactly the same input arguments, leading to
loopcheck.m:022:   infinite recursion.
