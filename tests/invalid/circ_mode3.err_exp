circ_mode3.m:013: Error: mode name `circ'/0 expands to a mode containing
circ_mode3.m:013:   itself, which means that processing any reference to it
circ_mode3.m:013:   would require an infinite sequence of expansions.
circ_mode3.m:015: Error: mode name `circ1'/0 expands to a mode containing
circ_mode3.m:015:   itself through `circ2'/0, which means that processing any
circ_mode3.m:015:   reference to it would require an infinite sequence of
circ_mode3.m:015:   expansions.
