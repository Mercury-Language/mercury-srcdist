===============

This repository holds the contents of Mercury source distribution tarballs.
Each source distribution is held in a tagged commit. You can clone the entire
repository and then check out the tag that you are interested in, or you can
download a release from Github from the
[releases](https://github.com/Mercury-Language/mercury-srcdist/tags)
tab. To browse the list of available tags, it may be most convenient to follow
this link to the
[initial commit](https://github.com/Mercury-Language/mercury-srcdist/commit/9101f6d96bc9d0e2ec0f84048d85b00c4826a595)
then click on the ellipsis (...) to expand the list of tags.

To keep a clone up-to-date, please use `git fetch --tags`.

Prior to about 2013, the "extras" directory was distributed as separate
"mercury-extras" packages; those packages have not been imported.
