This directory contains source code for handling Reduced Ordered
Binary Decision Diagrams (ROBDDs).  bryant.c contains almost all of
the code; bryantPrint.c contains only code for printing ROBDDs.

This code could really use a good spring cleaning.  My apologies for
not taking the time to do that yet.  Much of the complication of the
code stems from maintaining several different versions of the code in
a single file.  For users of this code these versions are probably not
very interesting.  They are there for experimenting with various
implementations.


Building the ROBDD code:

A Makefile is provided; if you just wish to link the ROBDD code with
your own code, making bryant.o and maybe bryantPrint.o should be
enough.

If you wish to use this ROBDD code as part of my groundness analyzer,
then you just want to do

	make bryant.so

and then move bryant.so to ../analyzer/rep.so
