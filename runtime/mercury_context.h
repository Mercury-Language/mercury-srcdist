** mercury_context.h - defines Mercury multithreading stuff.
**
** A "context" is a Mercury thread.  (We use a different term than "thread"
** to avoid confusing Mercury threads and POSIX threads.)
** Each context is represented by a value of type MR_Context,
** which contains a detstack, a nondetstack, a trail (if needed), the various
** pointers that refer to them, a succip, and a thread-resumption continuation.
** Contexts are initally stored in a free-list.
** When one is running, the POSIX thread that is executing it has a pointer
** to its context structure `this_context'. (WARNING: code that manipulates
** contexts must set this_context itself; it cannot rely on the generic
** mechanisms below to set it.) When a context suspends, it calls
** `MR_save_context(context_ptr)' which copies the context from the
** various registers and global variables into the structure referred to
** by `context_ptr'. The context contains no rN or fN registers - all
** registers are "context save" (by analogy to caller-save).
**
** When a new context is created for a parallel conjunction, information is
** passed to and from the new context via the stack frame of the procedure that
** originated the parallel conjunction. The code of a parallel conjunct has
** access to that original stack frame via the `parent_sp' register.
**
** Contexts can migrate transparently between multiple POSIX threads.
**
** Each POSIX thread has its own heap and solutions heap (both allocated
** in shared memory). This makes GC harder, but enables heap allocation
** to be done without locking which is very important for performance.
** Each context has a copy of the heap pointer that is taken when it is
** switched out. If the POSIX thread's heap pointer is the same as the
** copied one when the context is switched back in, then it is safe for
** the context to do heap reclamation on failure.
**
** If MR_THREAD_SAFE is not defined, then everything gets executed within a
** single POSIX thread. No locking is required.

/*
** Each engine has one MR_Context structure loaded into it (in the engine field
** named MR_eng_context) from a context which is pointed to by the engine's
** MR_eng_this_context field. Fields which can be expected to be accessed at
** least several times between context switches are accessed via MR_eng_context
** while the rest are accessed via MR_eng_this_context (which requires
** following an extra pointer). Note that some fields are further cached
** in abstract machine registers, and some in fact are only ever accessed
** via these abstract machine registers. The saved copies of some these
** abstract machine registers are kept not in the named fields below, but in
** the engine's fake reg array.
**
** All fields accessed via MR_eng_context and via abstract machine registers
** should be mentioned in the MR_save_context and MR_load_context macros.
** All fields accessed via MR_eng_this_context should be mentioned in the
** MR_copy_eng_this_context_fields macro. All fields accessed via direct
** specification of the context need explicit code to set them in all places
** where we create new contexts: in the mercury_thread module for parallelism,
** and in the mercury_mm_own_stacks module for minimal model tabling.
**
** The context structure has the following fields. The documentation of each
** field says how it is accessed, but please take this info with a pinch of
** salt; I (zs) don't guarantee its accuracy.
**
** id               A string to identify the context for humans who want to
**                  debug the handling of contexts.
**                  (Not accessed.)
**
** size             Whether this context has regular-sized stacks or smaller
**                  stacks. Some parallel programs can allocate many contexts
**                  and most parallel computations should not require very
**                  large stacks. We allocate contexts with "smaller" stacks
**                  for parallel computations (although whether they are
**                  actually smaller is up to the user).
**                  (Accessed only when directly specifying the context.)
**
** next             If this context is in the free-list `next' will point to
**                  the next free context. If this context is suspended waiting
**                  for a variable to become bound, `next' will point to the
**                  next waiting context. If this context is runnable but not
**                  currently running then `next' points to the next runnable
**                  context in the runqueue.
**                  (Accessed only when directly specifying the context.)
**
** resume           A pointer to the code at which execution should resume
**                  when this context is next scheduled.
**                  (Accessed via MR_eng_this_context.)
**
** resume_owner_thread
** resume_c_depth
**                  These fields are used to ensure that when we enter a
**                  Mercury engine from C, we return to the same engine. If
**                  resume_owner_thread is NULL then this context can be
**                  executed by any engine. Otherwise the resume_owner_thread
**                  and resume_c_depth must match the engine's owner_thread
**                  and c_depth. See the comments in mercury_engine.h.
**                  (Both accessed only when directly specifying the context.)
**
** saved_owners
**                  A stack used to record the Mercury engines on which this
**                  context executed some C calls that called back into
**                  Mercury. We must execute this context in the correct
**                  engine when returning to those C calls.  See the comments
**                  in mercury_engine.h.
**                  (Accessed via MR_eng_this_context.)
**
** succip           The succip for this context.
**                  (Accessed via abstract machine register.)
**
** detstack_zone    The current detstack zone for this context.
** prev_detstack_zones
**                  A list of any previous detstack zones for this context.

**                  (Accessed via abstract machine register.)
**

** prev_nondetstack_zones
**                  A list of any previous nondetstack zones for this context.
**                  (Both accessed via MR_eng_context.)

** maxfr            The saved maxfr for this context.
**                  (Both accessed via abstract machine register.)

**                  (Accessed via MR_eng_context.)
** gen_next         The saved gen_next for this context.
