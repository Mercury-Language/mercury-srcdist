The master copy of each document is stored in texinfo format, from which
the info, dvi and html versions are derived automatically.

You can create postscript versions from either the dvi or html versions.
Due to the large spacing in texinfo-generated dvi files, the postscript file
generated from the html (manually via a browser such as xmosaic) will be
considerably shorter than the one derived from the dvi file.

The source for the Mercury library reference manual is generated automatically
from the library source files themselves.
