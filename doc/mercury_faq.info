1 Common programming errors
***************************

  1. _What does the error message "undefined symbol `'.'/2'" mean?_

     You need to explicitly import the `list' module

          :- import_module list.

     if your code uses lists. Similarly, if your code uses arithmetic
     operations, you will need to import the `int' and possibly `float'
     modules.


  2. _Why doesn't `X <= 3' work?_

     In Mercury, less-than-or-equal-to is written as `=<' not as `<=',
     which is used for reverse implication.


  3. _I defined a type like this: `:- type number ---> int ; float.'
     Why doesn't this work?_

     You tried to define a type that is an undiscriminated union of two
     types, which is not allowed by the Mercury type system.  The
     declaration above defines an enumerated type with two constants,
     "int" and "float".  This is not what you want, but it is legal
     Mercury, which is why you don't get an error message on the type
     declaration itself.


  4. _I get a "scope error" in an if-then-else.  I checked and both
     branches bind the same variables. What is the error?_

     This error generally happens if you attempt bind non-local
     variables in the _condition_ of the if-then-else.  For example,
     the following code attempts to bind `Value' in the call to
     `map.search', but `Value' occurs outside of the if-then-else -- in
     particular, it occurs in the head of the clause.

          :- pred map.search(map(K, V), K, V).
          :- mode map.search(in, in, out) is semidet.

          :- pred lookup(map(string, int), string, int).
          :- mode lookup(in, in, out) is det.

          lookup(Map, Key, Value) :-
                  (if map.search(Map, Key, Value) then
                          true
                  else
                          Value = -1
                  ).

     Binding non-local variables in the condition of an if-then-else is
     forbidden since it would be unsound; it would lead to inconsistent
     results.  For example, `(X = 1 -> Y = 1 ; Y = 2), X = 2' would
     fail, but `X = 2, (X = 1 -> Y = 1 ; Y = 2)' would succeed --
     breaking one of the fundamental laws of logic, `(P, Q) <=> (Q, P)'.

     Mode analysis therefore rejects such programs.  (In certain rare
     circumstances, the compiler may report this as a "mode error"
     rather than a "scope error".)  The way to fix such errors is to
     avoid binding non-local variables in the _condition_, and instead
     bind them in the _then_ part of the if-then-else.  So in the above
     example, you should introduce a new local variable, which we will
     call `Value1':

          lookup(Map, Key, Value) :-
                  (if some [Value1]
                          map.search(Map, Key, Value1)
                  then
                          Value = Value1
                  ;
                          Value = -1
                  ).

     The explicit existential quantifier is optional; if you prefer a
     slightly more succinct style you can write this as

          lookup(Map, Key, Value) :-
                  ( map.search(Map, Key, Value1) ->
                          Value = Value1
                  ;
                          Value = -1
                  ).

  5. _"I keep getting a link error `undefined symbol init_gc'.  Why?"_

     If you are using `mmake' to recompile your program, and you are
     overriding the default grade (e.g. by setting `GRADE=asm_fast' in
     your `Mmake' file), you must make sure that you do `mmake clean'
     every time you change grades.

2 Problems caused by unimplemented Mercury features
***************************************************

  1. _How can I avoid getting a compile-time error when I try to fill
     in a partially instantiated data structure?_

     At the moment, you can create a partially instantiated data
     structure, but you can't fill in the holes.  The reason is that
     the code that does the filling in must temporarily alias two
     variables together, and the current mode checker does not allow
     this.  This limitation will go away in the future.


  2. _I'm getting an error from the C compiler:_
          foo.c:45: initializer is not computable at load time


     You're using an old version of `gcc'.  Check that the version of
     `gcc' in your PATH is version 2.6.3 or later.  Mercury does not
     (at the current time) support versions of gcc earlier than 2.6.3.
     (Using the `--no-static-ground-terms' option may also solve this
     problem, but results in less efficient code.)

3 What to do when all else fails
********************************

  1. _I'm getting an error message that I don't understand.  What can I
     do?_

     Try compiling with the `-E' (`--verbose-error-messages') option.
     This option causes the compiler to give even more verbose
     descriptions than usual.


  2. _I followed the instructions in the user's guide, but it still
     didn't work. What do I do next?_

     Send email to `mercury-bugs@csse.unimelb.edu.au', and we'll try to
     solve your problem.
