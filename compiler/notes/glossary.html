<dl>

<dt> assertion
	<dd>
	A particular form of promise which claims to the compiler 
	that the specified goal will always hold. If useful, the 
	compiler may use this information to perform optimisations.

<dt> class context 
	<dd>
	The typeclass constraints on a predicate or function.

<dt> codeinfo
	<dd>
	a structure used by codegen.m

<dt> HLDS 
	<dd>
	The "High Level Data Structure".  See hlds.m.

<dt> inst
	<dd>
	instantiatedness.  An inst holds three different sorts of
      information.  It indicates whether a variable is free, partially
      bound, or ground.  If a variable is bound, it may indicate
      which functor(s) the variable can be bound to.  Also,
      an inst records whether a value is unique, or whether
      it may be aliased.

<dt> liveness
	<dd>
	this term is used to mean two quite different things!
	<ol>
	<li> There's a notion of liveness used in mode analysis:
	a variable is live if either it or an alias might be
	used later on in the computation.
	<li> There's a different notion of liveness used for code generation:
	a variable becomes live (is "born") when the register or stack
	slot holding the variable first acquires a value, and dies when
	that value will definitely not be needed again within this procedure.
	This notion is low-level because it could depend on the low-level
	representation details (in particular, `no_tag' representations
	ought to affect liveness).
	</ol>

<dt> LLDS
	<dd>
	The "Low Level Data Structure".  See llds.m.

<dt> mode 
	<dd>
	this has two meanings:
	<ol>
	<li> a mapping from one instantiatedness to another
		(the mode of a single variable)
	<li> a mapping from an initial instantiatedness of a predicate's
		arguments to their final instantiatedness
		(the mode of a predicate)
	</ol>
	
<dt> moduleinfo 
	<dd>
	Another name for the HLDS.

<dt> NYI 
	<dd>
	Not Yet Implemented.

<dt> predinfo
	<dd>
	the structure in HLDS which contains information about
	a predicate.

<dt> proc (procedure)
	<dd>
	a particular mode of a predicate.

<dt> procinfo 
	<dd>
	the structure in HLDS which contains
	information about a procedure.

<dt> promise
	<dd>
    	A declaration that specifies a law that holds for the 
	predicates/functions in the declaration. Thus, examples of promises
	are assertions and promise ex declarations.  More generally, the term 
	promise is often used for a declaration where extra information is 
	given to the compiler which it cannot check itself, for example in
	purity pragmas.

<dt> promise ex
	<dd>
	A shorthand for promise_exclusive, promise_exhaustive, and
	promise_exclusive_exhaustive declarations. These declarations 
	are used to tell the compiler determinism properties of a 
	disjunction.

<dt> RTTI
	<dd>
	The "RunTime Type Information". See rtti.m. A copy of a paper given
	on this topic is available 
	<a href="http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/research/mercury/information/papers/rtti_ppdp.ps.gz">here</a> in zipped Postscript format.

<dt> super-homogenous form (SHF)
	<dd>
	 a simplified, flattened form of goals, where
	each unification is split into its component pieces; in particular,
	the arguments of each predicate call and functor must be distinct
	variables.

<dt> switch
	<dd>
	a disjunction which does a case analysis on the toplevel
	functor of some variable.
