<h1>Glossary Of Terms Used In Mercury</h1>

<dl>

<dt> assertion
<dd>
A particular form of promise which claims to the compiler 
that the specified goal will always hold. If useful, the 
compiler may use this information to perform optimisations.

<dt> class context 
<dd>
The typeclass constraints on a predicate or function.

<dt> codeinfo
<dd>
Originally, the data structure that holds the state of the LLDS code generator.
Now, the data structure that holds the static part
of the state of the LLDS code generator.

<dt> HLDS 
<dd>
The "High Level Data Structure".

<dt> inst
<dd>
Instantiatedness.
An inst holds five different sorts of information.
<ul>
<li>
It indicates whether the program point to which it applies
is reachable or not.
<li>
It indicates whether a variable is free, partially bound, or ground.
<li>
It indicates whether a value is unique, or whether it may be aliased.
<li>
If a variable is bound, it may indicate
which functor(s) the variable can be bound to.
<li>
For higher order values, it indicates the modes of its arguments.
</ul>

<dt> liveness
<dd>
This term is used to mean two quite different things!
<ul>
<li>
There is a notion of liveness used in mode analysis:
a variable is live if either it or an alias
might be used later on in the computation.
<li>
There is a different notion of liveness used for code generation:
a variable becomes live (is "born")
when the register or stack slot holding the variable first acquires a value,
and dies when that value will definitely not be needed again
within this procedure.
This notion is low-level because
it could depend on the low-level representation details
(in particular, `no_tag' representations ought to affect liveness).
</ul>

<dt> LLDS
<dd>
The "Low Level Data Structure".

<dt> mode 
<dd>
This has two meanings:
<ul>
<li>
The mode of a single variable:
a mapping from one instantiatedness to another.
<li>
The mode of a predicate:
a mapping from an initial instantiatedness of a predicate's arguments
to their final instantiatedness.
</ul>

<dt> module_info 
<dd>
Another name for the HLDS.

<dt> NYI 
<dd>
Not Yet Implemented.

<dt> pred_info
<dd>
The structure in the HLDS which contains information about a predicate.

<dt> proc (procedure)
<dd>
A particular mode of a predicate.

<dt> proc_info 
<dd>
The structure in the HLDS which contains information about a procedure.

<dt> promise
<dd>
A declaration that specifies a law
that holds for the predicates/functions in the declaration.
Thus, examples of promises are assertions and promise ex declarations.
More generally, the term promise is often used for a declaration
where extra information is given to the compiler which it cannot check itself,
for example in purity pragmas.

<dt> promise ex
<dd>
A shorthand for promise_exclusive, promise_exhaustive,
and promise_exclusive_exhaustive declarations.
These declarations are used to tell the compiler
the determinism properties of a disjunction.

<dt> RTTI
<dd>
The "RunTime Type Information". See rtti.m.
A copy of a paper given on this topic is available 
<a href="http://www.mercurylang.org/documentation/papers/rtti_ppdp.ps.gz">here</a> in zipped Postscript format.

<dt> super-homogenous form (SHF)
<dd>
A simplified, flattened form of goals,
where each unification is split into its component pieces;
in particular, the arguments of each predicate call and functor
must be distinct variables.

<dt> switch
<dd>
A disjunction which does a case analysis
on the toplevel functor of the term bound to some variable.
