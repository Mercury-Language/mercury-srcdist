The compiler contains some code for the following features,
which are not yet completed, but which we hope to complete
at some time in the future:
<p>

<ul>
<li> There is a 
  <a href="http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/mercury/dotnet.html">`--target il'</a>
  option, which generates MSIL code for Microsoft's new
  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/net/">.NET Common Language Runtime</a>.
  We're still working on this.

<li> There is a `--target java' option, which generates Java.
     We still need to add support for Java foreign language interfacing,
     and implement the Mercury standard library for Java.

<li> Thread-safe engine (the `.par' grades).

<li> Independent AND-parallelism (the `&' parallel conjunction operator).
     See Tom Conway's PhD thesis.

<li>
We have incomplete support for a new, more expressive design for representing
information about type classes and type class instances at runtime. When
complete, the new design would allow runtime tests of type class membership,
it would allow the tabling of predicates with type class constraints,
and it would allow the debugger to print type_class_infos.

<li> We have added support for dynamic link libraries (DLLs) on Windows.
  This is not yet enabled by default because it has not yet been tested
  properly.

<li> There is a new `--optimize-constructor-last-call' option
  which identifies opportunities for LCO where a call
  is followed only by some constructor invocations.
  However, these opportunities are not exploited yet.

<li> There is a new garbage collector that does accurate garbage
  collection (hlc.agc grade).  See the comments in
  compiler/ml_elim_nested.m and the paper on our web page for more details.

<li> There is a `--generate-bytecode' option, for a new back-end
  that generates bytecode.  The bytecode generator is basically
  complete, but we don't have a bytecode interpreter.
</ul>
<p>

We also have some code that goes at least some part of the way towards
implementing the features below.   However, for these features, the
code has not yet been committed and thus is not part of the standard
distribution.

<p>

<ul>
<li> A new implementation of the mode system using constraints.
  This is on the "mode-constraints" branch of our CVS repository.

<li> Support for aliasing in the mode system.
  This is on the "alias" branch of our CVS repository.

<li> Support for automatic structure reuse (reusing old data
  structures that are no longer live, rather than allocating
  new memory on the heap) and compile time garbage collection
  This is on the "reuse" branch of our CVS repository.

<li> Better support for inter-module analysis and optimization.

<li> Support for GCC 3.3 in the native code back-end.
  This is on the "gcc_3_3" branch of our CVS repository.

</ul>

<h2>
Work Not In Progress
</h2>

The compiler also contains some code for the following features,
but work on them has stopped, since finishing them off would be
quite a bit more work, and our current priorities lie elsewhere.
Still, these could make interesting and worthwhile projects
if someone has the time for it.
<p>

<ul>
<li> A SOAP interface.

<li> A bytecode interpreter, for use with the `--generate-bytecode' option.

<li> Sequence quantification (see the
  <a href="http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/research/mercury/information/reports/minutes_15_12_00.html">description</a> from the meeting minutes).
</ul>
