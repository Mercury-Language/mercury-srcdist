<h1>Release Checklist for the Mercury Project</h1>

This file contains a checklist of the steps that must be
taken when releasing a new version of Mercury.
<p>
XXX Warning: this file looks to be <em>very</em> out of date.

<ol>
<li> Items for the next version (1.0) only:
	<ol>
	<li>
	Update w3/include/globals.inc as explained in the XXX comment there.
    Don't commit your changes to the main branch yet, because
	otherwise it would be installed on the WWW pages overnight.
	<li>
	Make sure that the runtime headers contain no symbols (function names,
	variable names, type names, struct/enum tags or macros) that do not
	begin with MR_.
	</ol>

<li> Make sure configure.in is updated to check for new features.

<li> Update the RELEASE_NOTES, NEWS, WORK_IN_PROGRESS, HISTORY,
     LIMITATIONS and BUGS files, and the compiler/notes/todo.html file.
     Don't forget to update the version number in RELEASE_NOTES for major
     releases.
     The HISTORY file should include the NEWS files from previous releases
     (reordered if appropriate -- the HISTORY file is in cronological
     order whereas the NEWS file is in reverse cronological order).

<li> Update the WWW documentation in the `w3' directory.
     Note that the sources for these HTML documents are in the files named
     include/*.inc and *.php3.
     <ul>
     <li> Update the RELEASE_INFO file with the name and CVS tag
          of the new release.

     <li> For minor releases, update release.html with a new entry about
	  this release (put it at the top of the page), and provide a
	  new link to download the release. See old-release.html for
	  examples.

     <li> For major releases, you will need to create some new web pages:<br>
          <dl>
          <dt> release-VERSION.html
          <dd> The release notes for this version.

	  <dt> release-VERSION-bugs.html
	  <dd> Any outstanding bugs for this release.
	       This should be the same as the BUGS file.

	  <dt> release-VERSION-contents.html
	  <dd> The contents of this distribution.
	       This should be the same as in the RELEASE_NOTES file.

      </dl>

	  You will need to add these new files to the list in the Makefile.
	  You will also need to update release.html and
	  current-release-bugs.html.
	  Move the old information in release.html to old-release.html.
	  Modify release.html to refer to the new html files you have
	  created, and change the links to download the release. 

     <li> Update the CURRENT_RELEASE and BETA_RELEASE variables in
	  tools/generate_index_html so that the new release is listed
	  first on the download page.

     <li> Don't commit your changes to the main branch yet, because
	  otherwise it would be installed on the WWW pages overnight.
     </ul>

<li> Use `cvs tag' or `cvs rtag' to tag all the files with a
     `version-x_y_z' tag.  The cvs modules that need to be tagged
     are `mercury', `clpr', `tests', and `mercury-gcc'.

<li> Edit the tools/test_mercury script in
     /home/mercury/public/test_mercury/scripts/mercury:
     set the RELEASE_VERSION and CHECKOUT_OPTS variables
     as explained in the comments there.

<li> Run tools/run_all_tests_from_cron on earth.
     (Or just wait 24 hours or so.) <p>

     This should have the effect of checking out a fresh copy, and doing

	<pre>
	touch Mmake.params &amp;&amp;
	autoconf &amp;&amp;
	mercury_cv_low_tag_bits=2 \
	mercury_cv_bits_per_word=32 \
	mercury_cv_unboxed_floats=no \
	sh configure --prefix=$INSTALL_DIR &amp;&amp;
	mmake MMAKEFLAGS='EXTRA_MCFLAGS="-O5 --opt-space"' tar
	</pre>
	
	<p>

    If it passes all the tests, it should put the resulting tar file in
    /home/mercury/public/test_mercury/test_dirs/earth/mercury-latest-stable
    and ftp://ftp.mercury.cs.mu.oz.au/pub/mercury/beta-releases.

<li>  Test it on lots of architectures. <br>

	<p>
    Make sure you test all the programs in the `samples' and `extras'
    directories.

<li>  Build binary distributions for those architectures.
      This step is now automated as part of tools/test_mercury,
      with the resulting binaries going in
      /home/mercury/public/test_mercury/test_dirs/$HOST/mercury-latest-{un,}stable.

<li>  Make sure to test the binary distributions!

<li>  Move the gzipped tar files from the /pub/mercury/beta-releases directory
      to the main /pub/mercury directory on the Mercury ftp site
      ftp://ftp.mercury.cs.mu.oz.au/pub/mercury.
      Copy the binary distributions to the same place.
      <p>

      For the Stonybrook mirror, email Konstantinos Sagonas 
      (Kostis.Sagonas@cs.kuleuven.ac.be) to tell him to copy them to 
      ftp://ftp.cs.sunysb.edu/pub/XSB/mercury. <p>
      Unfortunately this mirror is not automated, so don't worry about it
      except for major releases or important bug fixes. <p>

      The mirror at ftp://ftp.csd.uu.se/pub/Mercury is also automated.
      Sometimes the link to Sweden can cause delays.
      The person to contact regarding this one is Thomas Lindgren 
      (thomasl@csd.uu.se).

<li> Prepare a new "mercury-VERSION.lsm" file for this Mercury release
     (use the one already uploaded to
     ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/Incoming as a template). The
     version number, date, file sizes, and file names need to be updated
     for a new release.

<li> Upload "mercury-VERSION-compiler.tar.gz" and "mercury-VERSION.lsm" to
     ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/incoming/Linux. They will be moved to
     /pub/Linux/Incoming fairly quickly, and eventually should be moved
     to /pub/linux/devel/lang/mercury.

<li> Send "mercury-VERSION.lsm" to the lsm robot at lsm@execpc.com
     with the subject "add".
	
<li> Append "mercury-VERSION.lsm" to a release notice and send it to
     linux-announce@news.ornl.gov. This will post to comp.os.linux.announce.

<li>  Email mercury-announce@cs.mu.oz.au and cross-post announcement to
    comp.lang.misc, comp.lang.prolog, comp.lang.functional, comp.object.logic,
    and for major releases also to comp.compilers and gnu.announce.

<li>  Update the Mercury WWW home page (/local/dept/w3/unsupported/docs/mercury/*)
      by commiting the changes you made earlier.

<li> For major releases, move the commitlog file from its current location
     (in $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/commitlog) into a file specific to that release,
     such as "commitlog-0.12".  Create a new, empty commitlog file, making
     sure it is readable by everyone and writeable by group mercury (the
     commitlog file file is not managed by cvs itself, it is maintained by
     our own check-in scripts, so you don't need to do anything special to
     create this file).  Email the local mailing list to say that you have
     done this.
