% This module implements two related source-to-source transforms,
% both of which focus on goals that produce some variables, where these
% variables are not always required by the following computation.
%
% If there are no computation paths on which the variables produced by a goal
% may be needed, then the first transform deletes that goal.
%
% If the variables produced by a goal may be needed on some but not all
% computation paths, then the second transform moves that goal to the starts
% of those computation paths, thus avoiding the cost of executing the goal
% on all other computation paths. (This is related to the concept of partial
% redundancy elimination (PRE) for imperative languages.)
%
% Mercury has two constructs that make it possible for a variable to be needed
% on some computation paths but not others: switches and if-then-elses.
%
% In the case of switches, the alternative computation paths are those
% corresponding to the possible values of the switched-on variable, and
% not just the switch arms. Even if all switch arms need a variable, it
% is an optimization to copy the code generating that variable to the starts of
% all the switch arms if the switch is can_fail, i.e. there are some function
% symbols that the switched-on variable can be bound to that do not have arms.
%
% In the case of if-then-elses, the alternatives are the then part and
% the else part. Any variable needed by the condition is needed in both those
% computation paths.
%
% From the point of view of this transform, disjunctions are not branched
% control structures, because entering a disjunct does not preclude later
% entering another disjunct. Any variable needed by any disjunct must therefore
% be produced before control enters the disjunction. (In theory, a disjunct
% that cannot fail in a model_semi disjunction prevents entry to the following
% disjuncts, but any such following disjuncts will have been removed long ago
% by simplification.)
%
% Note that by avoiding the execution of a goal that appears in the original
% source code of the program, both these transforms can in general change the
% operational semantics of the program. Therefore a goal can only be eliminated
% or moved if the goal is has no observable effect except the result it
% generates (i.e is pure, cannot fail, cannot loop, cannot raise an exception),
% which is usually true only of goals composed entirely of builtins, or if
% the semantics options explicitly permit the change in the operational
% semantics, which will usually be an improvement (e.g. avoiding an infinite
% loop or an unnecessary exception).

    % The branch_alts and branch_point types record the information the

    --->    alt_ite         % If-then-elses always have two alternatives:
                            % the then branch (numbered 1) and the else branch
                            % (numbered 2).

    ;       alt_switch(maybe(int)).
                            % The number of alternatives in a switch is equal
                            % to the number of function symbols in the type of
                            % the switched-on variable. This number is given by
                            % the argument integer, if present; if the argument
                            % is "no", then the number of function symbols in
                            % the type is effectively infinite (this can happen
                            % for builtin types such as "int"). If the switch
                            % cannot_fail, then this will be equal to the
                            % number of cases; if the switch can_fail, there
                            % will be strictly fewer cases than this.

    % The location type identifies one arm of a branched control structure.
    % The branched control structure id is a branch_point instead of a
    % simple goal_path because without the branch_alts info, the
    % transformation cannot tell if a given set of branches of a branched
    % control structure covers all possible execution paths or not.
    %
:- type location
    --->    location(
                branch_point,   % To which branched control structure
                                % does the location belong.
                int             % The branch within that control structure.
            ).

    % The where_needed_map type maps each variable to the set of
    % computation branches where it is needed. If a variable is needed
    % everywhere, then the computation producing it cannot be eliminated
    % or moved. If it is not needed at all, its producer can be eliminated.
    % If it is needed on some but not all branches, then the producer
    % can be moved to the starts of those branches.
    %
    % The set of branches to whose starts the producer can be moved
    % is represented as a map from the id of the branched control
    % structure to the set of branch numbers within that branched control
    % structure. If the branched control structure at goal path gp is
    % mapped to a set including N, then the producer of that variable
    % may be moved to the start of the goal with goal path <gp>;sN;
    % (if the control structure is a switch) or <gp>;t; or <gp>;e;
    % (if the control structure is an if-then-else).
    %
    % Since <gp>;sN; is conjoined with e.g. <gp>;sN;<gp2>;sM;
    % it would be a mode error (variable having two conjoined producers)
    % for the transformed code to have the producer of some variable
    % inserted at the start of both those goals. It is therefore an
    % invariant that a where_needed structure mapping gp to N
    % will not contain any keys whose goal_path includes <gp>;sN;
    % or its if-then-else equivalent.
    %
    % An example:
    %
    %   % switch on X at goal path gp
    %   ( % s1
    %       X = a,
    %       ... code that needs Y and Z ...
    %   ; % s2
    %       X = b,
    %       ( Y = f ->
    %           ... code that needs only Z ...
    %       ;
    %           ... code that does not need Y or Z ...
    %       )
    %   )
    %
    % X is needed everywhere, since even if X is bound to c, its value must
    % be tested.
    %
    % Y is needed everywhere iff the type of X contains only a and b,
    % otherwise it is needed only in the <gp>;s1; and <gp>;s2; switch arms.
    %
    % Z is needed in <gp>;s1; and <gp>;s2;t; but is not needed in the
    % <gp>;s2;e; else arm. Therefore the where_needed_branches map for Z
    % will map gp to 1 and <gp>;s2; to 1.

% The source-to-source transform operates in two phases.
%
% The first phase traverses the procedure body, keeping track of which
% variables are needed where. When it finds a goal that can be deleted,
% it deletes it by replacing it with the goal `true'. When it finds a goal
% that can be moved, it does the same, but also records in the RefinedGoalsMap
% that the deleted goal must later be inserted at the starts of the branches
% where its outputs may be needed, and accordingly notes that its own inputs
% are needed in those branches.
%
% The second phase traverses the modified problem body, and inserts the
% goals in the RefinedGoalsMap at the starts of the indicated branches.
% This phase identified the indicated branches by the goal_path annotations
% on their parents. These may be out of date since the first phase will have
% deleted some goals, but since neither phase modifies the goal_path annotation
% on a goal once that goal has been inserted into the RefinedGoalsMap,
% this does not matter.
%
% Neither phase traverses the internals of a goal that has been moved.
% To make sure that such goals are optimized whenever possible, the algorithm
% invokes itself recursively whenever it was able to successfully (delete or)
% move a goal. This cannot lead to infinite recursion, since each iteration
% will strictly reduce the number of computation paths on which a subgoal
% of the procedure body is executed. Since both the number of subgoals and
% computation paths are finite, the recursion must end.
