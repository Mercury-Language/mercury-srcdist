% File:     purity.m
% Authors:  scachte (Peter Schachte, main author and designer of purity system)
%           trd (modifications for impure functions)
% Purpose:  handle `impure' and `promise_pure' declarations;
%           finish off type checking.
%
% The main purpose of this module is check the consistency of the `impure' and
% `promise_pure' (etc.) declarations, and to thus report error messages if the
% program is not "purity-correct".  This includes treating procedures with
% different clauses for different modes as impure, unless promised pure.
%
% This module also calls post_typecheck.m to perform the final parts of
% type analysis, including resolution of predicate and function overloading
% (see the comments in that file).
%
% These actions cannot be done until after type inference is complete,
% so they need to be a separate "post-typecheck pass"; they are done
% here in combination with the purity-analysis pass for efficiency reasons.
%
% We also do elimination of double-negation in this pass.
% It needs to be done somewhere after quantification analysis and
% before mode analysis, and this is a convenient place to do it.
%
% This pass also converts calls to `private_builtin.unsafe_type_cast'
% into `generic_call(unsafe_cast, ...)' goals.
%
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------%
%
% The aim of Mercury's purity system is to allow one to declare certain parts
% of one's program to be impure, thereby forbidding the compiler from making
% certain optimizations to that part of the code.  Since one can often
% implement a perfectly pure predicate or function in terms of impure
% predicates and functions, one is also allowed to promise to the compiler
% that a predicate *is* pure, despite calling impure predicates and
% functions.
%
% To keep purity/impurity consistent, it is required that every impure
% predicate/function be declared so.  A predicate is impure if:
%
%   1.  It's declared impure, or
%   2a. It's not promised pure, and
%   2b. It calls some impure predicates or functions.
%
% A predicate or function is declared impure by preceding the `pred' or
% `func' in its declaration with `impure'.  It is promised to be pure with a
%
%   :- pragma promise_pure(Name/Arity).
%
% directive.
%
% Calls to impure predicates may not be optimized away.  Neither may they be
% reodered relative to any other goals in a given conjunction; ie, an impure
% goal cleaves a conjunction into the stuff before it and the stuff after it.
% Both of these groups may be reordered separately, but no goal from either
% group may move into the other.  Similarly for disjunctions.
%
% Semipure goals are goals that are sensitive to the effects of impure goals.
% They may be reordered and optimized away just like pure goals, except that
% a semipure goal may behave differently after a call to an impure goal than
% before.  This means that semipure (as well as impure) predicates must not
% be tabled.  Further, duplicate semipure goals on different sides of an
% impure goal must not be optimized away.  In the current implementation, we
% simply do not optimize away duplicate semipure (or impure) goals at all.
%
% A predicate either has no purity declaration and so is assumed pure, or is
% declared semipure or impure, or is promised to be pure despite calling
% semipure or impure predicates.  This promise cannot be checked, so we must
% trust the programmer.
%
% See the language reference manual for more information on syntax and
% semantics.
%
% The current implementation now handles impure functions.
% They are limited to being used as part of an explicit unification
% with a purity indicator before the goal.
%
%   impure X = some_impure_func(Arg1, Arg2, ...)
%
% This eliminates any need to define some order of evaluation of nested
% impure functions.
%
% Of course it also eliminates the benefits of using functions to
% cut down on the number of variables introduced.  The main use of
% impure functions is to interface nicely with foreign language
% functions.
%
% Any non-variable arguments to the function are flattened into
% unification goals (see unravel_unifications in superhomogeneous.m)
% which are placed as pure goals before the function call itself.
%
% Wishlist:
%   It would be nice to use impure functions in DCG goals as well as
%   normal unifications.
%
%   It might be nice to allow
%       X = impure some_impure_fuc(Arg1, Arg2, ...)
%   syntax as well.  But there are advantages to having the
%   impure/semipure annotation in a regular position (on the left
%   hand side of a goal) too.  If this is implemented it should
%   probably be handled in prog_io, and turned into an impure
%   unify item.
%
%   It may also be nice to allow semipure function calls to occur
%   inline (since ordering is not an issue for them).
%
% To do:
%   Reconsider whether impure parallel conjuncts should be allowed.

% Check purity of a single predicate.
%
% Purity checking is quite simple.  Since impurity /must/ be declared, we can
% perform a single pass checking that the actual purity of each predicate
% matches the declared (or implied) purity.  A predicate is just as pure as
% its least pure goal.  While we're doing this, we attach a `feature' to each
% goal that is not pure, including non-atomic goals, indicating its purity.
% This information must be maintained by later compilation passes, at least
% until after the last pass that may perform transformations that would not
% be correct for impure code.  As we check purity and attach impurity
% features, we also check that impure (semipure) atomic goals were marked in
% the source code as impure (semipure).  At this stage in the computation,
% this is indicated by already having the appropriate goal feature.  (During
% the translation from term to goal, calls have their purity attached to
% them, and in the translation from goal to hlds_goal, the attached purity is
% turned into the appropriate feature in the hlds_goal_info.)
