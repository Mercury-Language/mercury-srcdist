# INSTALL - installation instructions and installation script
#	    for the binary distribution of Mercury.
#
# You need GNU C (3.4 or later) and GNU Make (3.69 or later) in order
# to use Mercury, though you don't need them to install this distribution.
# To use the Mercury debugger, you may also need GNU Readline.
#
# Step 0.  Extract the files from the gzipped tar archive.
#
#	   Note: the mercury-*.tar.gz file itself contains
#	   some other .tar.gz files (lib.tar.gz, info.tar.gz).
#	   Do NOT mess with these nested .tar.gz files;
#	   they will be extracted automatically in step 2.
#
# Step 1.  Run this script.  (Just type `sh INSTALL'.)
#
#	   By default, the files will be installed in the directory
#	   /usr/local/mercury-@VERSION@.
#	   If you want the files to be installed someplace else,
#	   use the `--prefix <directory>' option to `INSTALL'.
#
#	   For a list of other configuration options, use
#	   `sh INSTALL --help'.
#	   `--prefix <directory>', if specified, must precede any
# 	   other options.
#
# Step 3.  Check the permissions on the installed files.
#	   Add /usr/local/mercury-@VERSION@/bin to your PATH, and
#	   add /usr/local/mercury-@VERSION@/man to your MANPATH.
#	   add /usr/local/mercury-@VERSION@/info to your INFOPATH.
#	   You can also add a WWW link to the Mercury documentation in
#	   /usr/local/mercury-@VERSION@/lib/mercury/html to your WWW
#	   home page, and you may want to print out a hard-copy of the
#	   documentation from the DVI files in
#	   /usr/local/mercury-@VERSION@/lib/mercury/doc.
#
#	   If the binary distribution includes the deep profiler, then check
#	   whether "make install" was able to copy scripts/mdprof to the web
#	   server's CGI directory (normally /usr/lib/cgi-bin). This directory
#	   is often writeable only by root or by the web server administrator,
#	   so you may need more than your usual set of privileges to do the
#	   copy (i.e. you may need to "su" to the appropriate user).
#
#	   To use the emacs debugger interface ("M-x mdb"), you also need to
#	   add the following lines to the `.emacs' file in your home directory:
#
#	   	(setq load-path (cons (expand-file-name
#		  "/usr/local/mercury-@VERSION@/lib/mercury/elisp") load-path))
#		(autoload 'mdb "gud" "Invoke the Mercury debugger" t)
#
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------#
#
# De-installation:
# ----------------
#
# You may eventually want to uninstall this version of Mercury
# (to free up disk space so you can install the next version ;-).
# If you installed in the default location, you can simply
# use `rm -rf /usr/local/mercury-@VERSION@' to uninstall.
