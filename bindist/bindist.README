This directory contains a binary distribution of the
University of Melbourne Mercury compiler, version <VERSION>,
built on a `<FULLARCH>' system.

terms of the GNU General Public License.  See the file COPYING for
copying permission.  The Mercury library and runtime (libmer_std.* and

This distribution also contains a slightly modified version of the
conservative garbage collector distributed by Hans Boehm, version 6.5,
which has the following copyright attached (taken from the README file
of the garbage collector source):
