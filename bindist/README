This directory contains files used to create a binary distribution of
Mercury.  Files that will be incorporated in the binary distribution
start with `bindist.'.  The other files (this README, and the Mmake file)
are only used to build the distribution.

To build a binary distribution, first build and install the compiler
from the source distribution (see the instructions in ../INSTALL).
Then just do an `mmake bindist'.
