Please include the following information in your bug report:

  * the version of Mercury;
  * the system type;
  * a complete source file that demonstrates the problem;
  * the command line flags with which the Mercury compiler was invoked;
  * the name and version of the C compiler that you are using;

version of the Erlang, Java or C# implementation that you are using.

Please try to ensure that bug report contains all the information that we need to
be able to reproduce the problem.  Make sure that all bug reports are fully
self-contained.

described in the README.* files. See also the LIMITATIONS file.
